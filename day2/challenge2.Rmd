Create a Data for Everyone account on CrowdFlower and follow the instructions in the tutorial to launch a task with only internal coders (you!). You can either pick your own dataset of tweets (or any other dataset) or the one provided in the example.

Launch the task and code 10 tweets. Then, download the data and open it in R. Generate a couple of frequency tables just to take a look at the data and making sure all looks ok.

```{r}


```
