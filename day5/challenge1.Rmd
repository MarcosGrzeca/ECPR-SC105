```{r}


```

How many posts were published each month of the year?

```{r}


```


What is the average number of likes for members of the House and the Senate? Which group is more popular on average?

```{r}

```

What is the average number of likes that posts receive based on the time of the day in which they were published?

```{r}


```

Do women receive more comments than men on average?

```{r}

```
