Today is National Cancer Survivor’s Day. Almost all of us have or know a loved one who has battled cancer, so let’s be sure to celebrate those who have beaten this illness and do all that we can to eventually put an end to cancer altogether.
Today I announced a series of statewide veterans listening sessions and a legislative agenda to address access to care issues at the VA. I'm also outlining a process so my office can receive whistle blower complaints from VA staff. Veterans earned high quality, timely health care. I will continue my efforts to improve their lives.
