Sen. Sessions issued the following statement on the two-year anniversary of the devastating tornado outbreak that struck portions of central and northern Alabama:  “April 27th marks the two-year anniversary of the tornado outbreak that swept across Alabama. We continue to pray for those who lost their loved ones in these tragic storms. The devastation and aftermath will not soon be forgotten, but the everlasting impression will be of the resolve and pride the people of Alabama showed in aiding and caring for their fellow citizens in a time of great need. Today, we remember the lives lost, the towns affected, and the spirit of the people in this great state. I have seen first-hand the inspiring redevelopment, and we must be committed to seeing these rebuilding efforts through to ensure a full recovery.”
