Senator Shaheen issued the following statement this morning on the passing of Chief Warrant Officer Charlie Morgan of the New Hampshire National Guard:   â€œCharlie Morgan epitomized courage - in her military service, her fight for LGBT equality, and her battle with cancer. She showed us how to live and to die with dignity. I am honored I got to know Charlie and my heart goes out to her wife Karen, her daughter Casey Alena and her entire family."
