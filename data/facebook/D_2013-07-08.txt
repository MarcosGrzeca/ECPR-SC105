OP-ED: It’s time for the House to pass an immigration bill. They should take a hard look at the Senate version. There is no reason we can't work out a final bill to send to President Obama this summer to become law. With it, we'll pay homage to each of our families' histories, and our collective identity as a land of immigrants and a nation of laws.
Today I stopped by United Electric before jumping on the train to Washington D.C. to meet with the company's leadership and employees. United Electric has been in Delaware since 1965 and employs 127 people altogether at its locations in New Castle, Dover and Dagsboro.
I hope everyone had a fun, safe and patriotic Fourth of July! What did you do to celebrate our nation's independence?
Slashing Amtrak’s funding by one third at a time of increasing ridership will hurt Pennsylvania’s economy and reduce service along the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak adds a $200 million boost to our state’s economy every year and employs over 2,000 people. It is imperative that we make smart decisions about the budget that won't stunt job creation or harm the economy. - http://1.usa.gov/157Q5ZU

Congratulations to Spaulding High School seniors Naomie Clark, Ali Trueworthy, and Jackie McNally, who took the gold at this year's SkillsUSA National Competition in Kansas City. These young women are a great example of the innovative spirit of the Granite State and show the vital importance of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education that will help build the future of our country.
As Congress looks for ways to reduce our debt, it's time to bring common-sense to how we pay government contractors.  That's why I'm supporting a bipartisan bill that cuts pay for contractor executives and saves taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. 1.usa.gov/184JGok
As I return to Washington this week, I'll be fighting to keep student loan rates low for New Mexico students and families. It's unacceptable that Congress last week let the rates double on new federal student loans. The cost of tuition is already rising too quickly, and the last thing we should do is balance budgets on the backs of New Mexicans who want to make a better life for themselves through education. One Las Cruces mom who went back to school last year as an adult summed up the dilemma. She already has a teenager in college and a mortgage to pay, but, she told the Las Cruces Sun-News: "I have no choice but to continue with my student loans if I ever want to make more than $10/hour!" Are you a student in New Mexico who relies on federal loans to pay for education? If so, how would this rate increase affect you? Tell me your story in the comments section and share this post if you agree - we need a long–term solution to the skyrocketing cost of college for students in New Mexico.
Today, as RI continues rebuilding from Hurricane Sandy, the RI Congressional delegation and I brought President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Task Force staff on a tour of storm-damaged sites in South Kingstown and Westerly. We had a chance to discuss efforts to rebuild and make these areas more resilient in the face of future storms. Many thanks to the Task Force for making the trip, and to the many South Kingstown and Westerly town officials for their hard work planning this extremely helpful tour.
After 30 years, a Virginia veteran's son has finally located the American flag his father made with a bed sheet and colored pencils in a WWII POW camp. I asked the Navy to loan the flag to the Virginia War Memorial in Richmond for display: http://1.usa.gov/12mt3LO
