Today I'm heading to Farmington, Fredericktown, and Greenville to hear from local leaders who are impacted by the Obama Administration's executive over-reach and costly regulations. Missourians are rightly concerned about executive over-reach and dysfunction under the current administration. That's why I introduced the ENFORCE the Law Act in the Senate to hold the president to his constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the law.

Did you see the story on the news about the Russian planes near Alaskan airspace? Alaska represents America's front lines and the tip of the spear against the Asia-Pacific region.  Russia's antagonistic behavior further reminds us of the need for both an active diplomatic and military presence. When I fight to defend and strengthen Alaska's military infrastructure, itâ€™s in the best interests of both our state and the nation. On the plus side: It's a good thing having Alaska F-22s (and soon, F-35s) there to greet the Russians on a moments notice.
Today on POW/MIA Recognition Day, Alaskans are honoring prisoners of war, the missing, and their families.  We must #NeverForget their sacrifice and the price they paid.
I'm hosting an Energy Jobs Fair in St. Clairsville next week. It's a good opportunity for job seekers to meet with employers and I'm looking forward to seeing many Ohioans there. More details can be found here:
