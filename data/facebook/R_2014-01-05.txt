More from Haskins: "We already spend more than enough money on means-tested programs for poor and low-income people to bring them all out of poverty. There were about 46.5 million people in poverty in 2012, a year in which spending on means-tested programs was around $1 trillion."
Haskins: "Rather than look to government for the complete solution to poverty, we should also focus attention on three factors that are directly linked to poverty and are under the control of individual Americans – education, family composition, and work."

For the third year in a row, the NDSU Bison have shown their mettle with another great season and championship win. The Tigers played a spirited game, but the Bison offense and defense were unstoppable. Congratulations and best wishes to Coach Bohl, who coached his last game with Bison today, as well as Athletics Director Gene Taylor and NDSU President Dean Bresciani for their leadership at NDSU. And a special thank you to the Bison players, who once again performed with consummate skill and style. We also want to thank Coach Rob Ambrose and the Towson players for playing with their hearts to the very last play of the game. Mikey and I celebrating with Bison fans after the game in Frisco. The mood is electric..... Go Bison!
Mikey and I had a great time in Frisco, seeing old friends & cheering on the #GoBison #NDSUFrisco
