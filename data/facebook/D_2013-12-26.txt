Senator Hoeven and I called on the FBI and White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to help address the sharp increase in crime in western North Dakota. In July, I brought the ONDCP Director out to our state to talk about ways to prevent drug abuse, improve treatment, and build healthier and safer communities across the growing region.
So sorry to hear about the passing of Capt. Edmund Johnson - co-founder of the Pease Greeters - who did such dedicated and important work on behalf of New Hampshire veterans. My thoughts are with his friends and family. http://bit.ly/1jLN4dp
