Another thing to be thankful for...hikes in the Sandias with my family.
Small businesses are the heart of New Mexico's economy - did you #shopsmall today for Small Business Saturday? I visited Joliesse Chocolates in Los Ranchos de Albuquerque. Joliesse Chocolates received funding through USDA Rural Development, a program I'm proud to support as a member of the agriculture and rural development appropriations subcommittee.
As N.M. parents head to the stores to buy toys for their kids, it's important to know how to avoid hidden safety hazards. Today, CPSC Commissioner Marietta Robinson and Dr. Loretta Cordova de Ortega, head of pediatrics at UNM Hospitals, joined me for a discussion about toy safety - something I've been working on for many years. Small parts, powerful magnets, and expandable or inflatable toys like balloons all can be dangerous for small children. For example, if a toy fits in a cardboard toilet paper tube, it might be a choking hazard. Visit the CPSC for more information. http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/Toys/
