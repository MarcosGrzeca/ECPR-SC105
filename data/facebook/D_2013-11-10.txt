Today marks the 238th birthday of the United States Marine Corps. The origins of the Marine Corps can be traced back to the Continental Marines of War for American Independence. The Second Continental Congress established the Marine Corps on November 10, 1775. Pennsylvania’s long and storied tradition of Corps also dates back to Captain Samuel Nicholas of Philadelphia, who was the first officer commissioned in the Continental Marines. From America’s inception to today, these brave men and women truly embody the Marines’ motto “Semper Fidelis” by their persistent honor and courage. Join me in wishing the United States Marine Corps, and all those that have served within the ranks of the few and the proud, a happy birthday.
