Today is the 70th anniversary of the original G.I. Bill. I was one of the 20 million Americans who was able to benefit from this legislation while receiving my graduate degree at the University of Delaware. As veterans today return from Iraq and Afghanistan, they will have access to new and improved educational benefits from the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill. Providing educational and employment opportunities for veterans will continue to be a priority of mine. http://1.usa.gov/1ptdd1m
Good luck tonight to the US Men’s National Soccer Team, Fort Wayne native DaMarcus Beasley and former Notre Dame standout Matt Besler, as they take on Portugal in their second match of the  #WorldCup. Earlier this year I signed “The Ball” as part of the Spirit of Football’s journey to 25 countries en route to Brazil for the World Cup. Go Team USA! -Joe #USMNT #OneNationOneTeam #1N1T

The firefighters have made great progress battling the Assayii Lake Fire. I commend the Navajo Nation Emergency Operations Center, Central Consolidated Schools District, volunteers, and community members for coming together to provide donations, shelter, and meals for the firefighters and families who were evacuated during this emergency.
