Congratulations and good luck to the McAllen Fire Department! They will be competing as one of three finalists in Good Morning America's 5-Alarm Firefighters Challenge this Monday morning.  If they win, the $10,000 prize will benefit the Texas Line of Duty Death Task Force which provides assistance to those who have been injured in the line of duty and to the families of those who have died in the line of duty.
The London Metropolitan Police Department has great taste in cars!  They're patrolling the streets of London in BMW X5s made in -- you guessed it -- South Carolina.    I'm in London this weekend attending the annual Farnborough International Airshow in support of the Boeing 787 Dreamliners also made in South Carolina. #PalmettoPride #PalmettoPrideintheUK
Verne and I are out flipping for reds on the Kenai River. Here's our first fish of the morning!
I had a great day today on the Kenai Peninsula at the Funny River Festival, catching up with Alaskans.  While there, I was honored to be able to thank the fire fighting community in person who came to the rescue with the recent fire that burned over 196,000 acres. Alaskans are exceptionally thankful for what they're doing and what they've done.
