Today is Gold Star Mother’s Day, a solemn day to recognize the unfathomable sorrow of mothers who have lost a son or daughter while in the service of the United States Armed Forces.  I’d like to express my reverence, deep respect, and gratitude for the service and sacrifice of these mothers and their families to our nation.
This is a crisis manufactured and perpetuated solely by Congressional Republicans who allowed a Tea Party takeover of the Republican Party in Washington. These Washington politicians who receive quality health care themselves are insistent on delaying health care for millions of Americans. Unless Republican leaders get control of their party, extreme right ideology will take precedence over the middle class, jobs, economic growth and national defense.  If our government shuts down, the extreme right wins and middle class Pennsylvanians will be harmed. #NoShutdown
