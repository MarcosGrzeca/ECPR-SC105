ECPA reform has majority support in the House.  The Senate version of this bill that I introduced with Senator Patrick Leahy has bipartisan support.  Over 100,000 of you signed the petition for the White House to indicate whether they support requiring law enforcement officials to get a warrant to read your email, and the White House hasn't responded yet.  They did, however, find time to respond to the petition about whether Justin Bieber should be deported.  Tech industry leaders support this reform.  When most Americans learn why this reform is needed, they are shocked to find out how far their privacy rights have eroded after decades of big government overreach.  Why do you think leaders in Congress and the president don't push for the passage of this reform that enjoys such wide support in Congress and among the American people?
Is it fair that salaried workers and government workers have the advantage of comp-time but hourly workers do not?  Should we be giving the government a competitive advantage in hiring?  I have introduced the Working Families Flexibility Act to level this playing field.  
During my time in Smith County, I also visited the Courthouse Square Veterans Memorial, which is a tribute to Smith County veterans. The memorial was planned by a group of interested military veteran volunteers, and it was an honor to speak at its dedication in 2002.
