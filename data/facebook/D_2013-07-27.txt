Today, July 27th, marks the 60th Anniversary of the armistice that halted the hostilities of the Korean War.  I would like to honor the service and sacrifice of the veterans that fought to preserve the freedom of South Korea.  As a nation, we must ensure that we always remember those that fought and died in the “Forgotten War”.
"I am honored to welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden to Hawaii to meet with our troops and proud military ohana." -Senator Schatz
Today we celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the armistice that ended combat in the Korean War.  The Korean War is sometimes called the 'Forgotten War,' but it will never be forgotten for the thousands of brave Montanans who fought in the conflict and made tremendous sacrifices for our freedom.
