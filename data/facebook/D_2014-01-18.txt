In the first of a two-part interview, I talk to John Taylor about the Delaware Way and my role chairing the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. Take a look!

Today I met with Fargo and Cass County officials, Senator Hoeven, Congressman Cramer and Governor Dalrymple to talk about safety issues with rails that move through the center of large communities, like Fargo. We also discussed the clean-up procedures from the train derailment near Casselton, and ways to improve rail safety in the region. Our priority is to make sure North Dakotans are safe in their communities and that we work to do everything we can to prevent future problems.
