Senator Shaheen released the following statement on the passing of former New Hampshire Senate President David Nixon.  â€œDave was a dear friend whose love for New Hampshire was evident in everything he did. I appreciated his counsel over the years and all of his dedicated service for our veterans. He spent his entire career as a lawyer and public servant fighting for the most vulnterable among us. His heart was big and his voice was strong. He will be missed, and my thoughts are with his family and friends."
