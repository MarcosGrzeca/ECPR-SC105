Good to hear Bart is getting better. Still in our prayers. - rj
I'm back home in Plainville today and having lunch at the Rooks County Health Center. Pictured with me here is Gary Hicks of Plainville and Harold Dennett of Palco. Gary served from 1970-1976 in the Marines, and is a retired Eastern Heights teacher.    Harold, 92, served as a Army combat engineer during WWII from 1942-1946. He agreed to take a photo only if he could say he loves his daughters: Denise, Rita, Linda and Carol on Facebookâ€”though he doesn't really know what that is. His wife of 70 years, Juanita, passed away one year ago today. We honor and thank our veterans and their families.
Went to Fred Meyer this morning in Anchorage.  Picked up the family pumpkin, spices for rhubarb chutney -- and got my flu shot.  It's officially fall!
