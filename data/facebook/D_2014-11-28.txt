I am concerned that our strategy lacks two important elements: a recognition that the Assad regime in Syria also must go and a strategy to address the underlying issues that created the space for the Islamic State to emerge and metastasize.
The U.S. Air Forceâ€™s new plan will make Powder River Training Complex the largest training airspace over the continental U.S. It will enable servicemembers at Minot Air Force Base to expand their mission, reinforcing the crucial military work done in our state, and it will bring servicemembers from around the country to this region to get top notch training to help them protect our country. At the same time, we need to also make sure the Air Force keeps its promise to limit the impact of the expansion on our communities, businesses, local airports, pilots, ranchers, and tribes who rely on our land and unobstructed air space to do their jobs. By working together with the Air Force and our local towns and businesses, we can strike the right balance between strengthening our national security and heeding the economic, cultural, and safety concerns of our communities.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Glad to be able to help kick off the Red Kettle Campaign in Santa Fe today. Thanks to all of the volunteers working hard to help those in need this season!
