Kurt Luger of Great Plains joined Senator Heitkamp at NIGA today in Washington. He presented the Senator with a necklace his wife made for her.
Joined members of the First African Baptist Church for a clean-up of Battery Park in my neighborhood in Richmond as part of the National Day of Service honoring Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
It's fitting that Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is the only federal holiday also observed as a day of service. This year, we celebrate the life and legacy of MLK on a special Saturday National Day of Service, and I encourage you to join us in helping a fellow citizen or neighbor.  Click below to find a volunteer project in your local community and click share to encourage others as well. Remember, as Dr. King so eloquently said, "Everybody can be great...because anybody can serve."
For more than two hundred years, America's citizens have witnessed the Inauguration ceremonies of the President and Vice President of the United States. From the first Inauguration of George Washington to today, the swearing-in ceremonies represent both national renewal and continuity of leadership. As we prepare for the 57th Presidential Inauguration, I wish everyone a safe and pleasant weekend, and safe travels to those on their way from New Mexico!
