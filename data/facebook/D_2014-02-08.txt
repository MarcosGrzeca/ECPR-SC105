What's your message for our athletes in #Sochi? Write it in the comments below. As the home of the U.S. Olympic Committee as well as many Olympic and Paralympic athletes, Colorado knows a thing or two about the Olympic spirit. These athletes have dedicated years to training for this special opportunity to represent our country on the world stage. My family and I are anxious to cheer on Team USA as they compete for Olympic gold. We wish them all safe travels and the best of luck as they demonstrate their skills and competitive spirit in Sochi.
I take the train into Union Station every day from Wilmington and Amtrak’s commitment to new infrastructure is great to see.  With this new energy-efficient locomotive that has parts from 23 states, I am more excited than ever about my ride to work.
Good luck to Team USA in Sochi! We’ll all be watching and cheering from home. We know you’ll make us proud!
Great time today at the Wounded EOD Warrior Foundation Polar Bear Plunge in Fredericksburg. The water is 35 degrees - now THAT's commitment!
