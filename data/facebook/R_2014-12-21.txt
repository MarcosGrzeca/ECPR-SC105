Merry Christmas eve, eve, eve, eve
Sen. Johnson appeared this morning on Fox News Sunday alongside Senator Ben Cardin to discuss U.S. - #Cuba relations. You can watch below.
Here are several photos I thought I would share from our #TakeThePlungeAK at Goose Lake today.
It was wonderful to see hundreds of Alaskans #FreezinForAReason today in support of Special Olympics Alaska!
I have just returned from a five day trip to Iraq and Kuwait. I'll have more information to share about what I saw there in the coming days, but first know that morale is high. We are making progress against ISIL. I was very impressed by the hard work and skill of the men and women of the Big Red One and the Marines I met with. I thanked them for their sacrifice, especially being away from their families at the holidays.
Happy Holidays from Franki and I and some of our dedicated staff!
My thoughts and prayers are with the NYPD and all law enforcement and their families tonight.
