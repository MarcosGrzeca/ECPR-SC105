Tonight I had the opportunity to attend the Howard Rock and Ted Stevens Smokehouse Gala in Anchorage, named in honor of two lifelong champions of Alaska Native peoples. This Gala celebrates and recognizes the contributions of Alaska Native peoples and those that continue to advance and build strong relationships into Alaskaâ€™s promising future.   I congratulate all who were honored tonight, including Paul and Martina John of Toksook Bay, for receiving the esteemed Alaska Native Leader Howard Rock Award. Paul and Martina are known as passionate advocates of their culture, language, and ways of life.
