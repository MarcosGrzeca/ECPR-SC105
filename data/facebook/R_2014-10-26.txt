Diana and I were heartbroken to learn of the passing of Al Wiederspahn, Rep. Cynthia Lummis' husband.  I got to serve with Al when he was a legislator. He has been a leader and a risk taker as he improved Cheyenne, particularly keeping the downtown vital. He has also provided support and encouragement for Cynthia. He will be missed. Our prayers are with Cynthia and Annaliese.
Looking forward to another big win from our Green Bay Packers tonight! #GoPackGo
