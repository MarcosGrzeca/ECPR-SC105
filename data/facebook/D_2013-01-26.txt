This morning, Joe took part in the annual Granger Food Drop where five churches and community leaders donated close to 8,000 boxes of food across Michiana. Volunteers worked together to load close to 100,000 lbs of food in trucks that will reach communities from Elkhart and South Bend to LaPorte and Middlebury. A big thanks goes to Granger Community Church, South Gate Church, and Waypoint Church for coordinating this annual event. "Share" this post with your friends and let's always help Hoosiers in need.
I’m joining Candy Crowley on CNN State of the Union tomorrow at 9 a.m. EST. I will speak with Bob Schieffer on Face The Nation at 10 a.m. EST about gun policy and getting weapons of war off our streets.

Every year many people fail to file for the Earned Income Tax Credit because they don’t know about it…in fact, approximately 21% of eligible individuals nationwide did not claim the EITC in 2012. Today, in honor of Earned Income Tax Awareness Day, I spoke at an event in Woonsocket, highlighting information about EITC and free tax preparation help. While today's event was great, I want to make sure that you have the same information too. Please use the link below for EITC information.
