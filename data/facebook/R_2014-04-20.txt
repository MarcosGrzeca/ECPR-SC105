Happy Easter!
I was pleased to participate in this conference, where I explained that public education in Utah and elsewhere is suffering as a result of bad public land management policies: 
I hope you and your family are celebrating a meaningful Easter. I am spending today with my family in Manhattan. We are joining the congregation of First Presbyterian Church and Robba will be playing piano during Easter Sunday service. Also this week, families and friends across the world are gathering to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Passover. I hope the Jewish community across Kansas is enjoying a happy holiday as well.
Ramona Rock's delicious donuts - I know these perfect pastries helped fuel the crew that landed the whale today.
As families across Ohio and around America join together to celebrate this special holiday and the promise it holds for a better and more peaceful world, I want to wish everyone a Happy Easter.
Very happy Easter from my family to yours!
He is risen!  Happy Easter!
