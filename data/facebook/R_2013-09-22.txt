#DefundObamacareBecause it's hurting the American people.
Saying a prayer for the safety and well-being of these sailors.
If the Senate majority is going to amend the House-passed CR to defund Obamcare with only 51 votes, Senate Republicans should support House Republicans by opposing cloture. #DontFundIt #DefundObamacare

When we initially proposed to #DefundObamacare, the Washington establishment attacked it.  Some said it is not physically or legally possible to pass a bill that funds government but defunds Obamacare.  We've seen all those things are untrue.  We've seen the American people are rallying around this idea.  They have seen the president acting to protect big business, big unions and other special interests, and they want to be protected, too.
