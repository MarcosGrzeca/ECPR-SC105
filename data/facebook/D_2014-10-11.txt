I got a tour of the Biggs Museum of American Art this past Thursday and the renovation looks great! Check out this Delaware gem during October – Delaware’s Arts and Humanities month.
I applaud the Nobel Committee for choosing to honor champions for children’s rights this year in their selection of Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai for the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize.  Kailash and Malala’s work to ensure that boys and girls around the world have access to education and are able to enjoy their childhood without fear of exploitation or oppression helps build a better future for our children at home and abroad.  Malala’s courage to stand up for girls’ right to education in Pakistan in the face of terrible violence should be an inspiration to all of us.  I extend my congratulations to both winners. 
UPDATE: I am pleased to announce, along with the National Park Service, Mayor Kenoi, and Rep. Gabbard an agreement to rebuild the Chain of Craters Road with 2-way emergency access.  The 2-lane road will be fully restored to the original 22-foot width.  This is welcome news for the people of Puna and a real team effort.  While there is still more to do, I am grateful we were able to work together to find a solution to this issue.
