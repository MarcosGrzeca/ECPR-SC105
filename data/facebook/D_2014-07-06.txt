My prayers are with the families of the officers, the IMPD and Gary PD after this weekend's tragic shootings in Indianapolis and Gary. Please pray for our beloved police officers. -Joe
Happy to be home with my family after a week of Intelligence Committee-related travel in the Middle East. Wishing all of you a safe and happy Fourth of July weekend.
