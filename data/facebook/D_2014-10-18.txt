New Mexicans have a deep connection to the outdoors and benefit from the recreation, wildlife, water, and tourism opportunities that wilderness provide. It’s special places like the Columbine-Hondo that inspire us all to continue to work together to ensure our public lands are protected now and for generations to come. #Wilderness50
On Wednesday, October 15, 2014, Senator Mikulski convened a Western Maryland College Affordability Summit at Allegany College of Maryland. The Summit, part of her statewide College Affordability Tour, focused on the many challenges Maryland students and families face in paying for higher education as well as the impact on jobs and communities. As the cost of higher education continues to rise at unprecedented rates and U.S. student loan debt balloons to roughly $1 trillion – a sum larger than Americans’ total collective credit card debt – Senator Mikulski is committed to finding new ways to make college a more attainable prospect for a greater number of Maryland students.
This week I continued my College Affordability Tour by convening a Western Maryland College Affordability Summit at Allegany College of Maryland. I heard first hand from students and administrators from Allegany College, Garrett College and Frostburg State University as well as local business leaders about the impact of skyrocketing student debt. We must reduce interest rates and increase graduation rates. I will continue to fight so Maryland families have a fair shot at higher education with a government on their side.
"We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the men and women who have served in uniform, and I am honored in sharing the Traveling Vietnam Memorial Wall with our veterans and their families. The Traveling Wall displays our profound thanks to the men and women who have served our country. I hope that for our veterans, their families and all Americans, the Traveling Wall provides an opportunity to heal and remember loved ones."  -JS
