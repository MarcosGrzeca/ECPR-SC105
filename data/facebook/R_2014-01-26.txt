When the President delivers his State of the Union address this week, he has a lot of explaining to do. If all he has to offer is more of the same, or if he refuses to acknowledge that his own policies have failed to work – the President is simply doing what many failed leaders have done before him: trying to set one group of Americans against another group of Americans. We don’t need more class warfare, and we don’t need more interference from Washington. No government program can replace what a good job means for the future of a family. I hope President Obama will use his so-called "year of action" to have a little less talk, and a lot more action. Please watch my thoughts during the GOP Weekly Address and let me know what you hope to hear during the President's State of the Union in the comments below.
