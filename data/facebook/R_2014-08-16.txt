Unfortunately, there has been a sad history of the Travis County District Attorney's Office engaging in politically-motivated prosecutions, and this latest indictment of the governor is extremely questionable.  Rick Perry is a friend, he's a man of integrity – I am proud to stand with Rick Perry. The Texas Constitution gives the governor the power to veto legislation, and a criminal indictment predicated on the exercise of his constitutional authority is, on its face, highly suspect.
On Friday morning, I was in WaKeeney to visit Trego County-Lemke Memorial Hospital, a 25-bed critical access hospital that provides inpatient, outpatient and emergency services. It was great to catch up with a number of friends during this visit, including Drs. Clark and Lang and nurses and staff from Plainville, Hays, Ellis, Stockton and WaKeeney. We discussed initiatives to recruit and retain health care providers to address medical workforce challenges in rural Kansas and the importance of critical access hospitals to our state’s health care delivery system. I appreciated having the opportunity to talk with acting hospital CEO Dave Augustine – thanks again for hosting me.
I visited Wright-Patterson AFB earlier this week and recommend checking out the National Museum of the USAF if you are in the area.
