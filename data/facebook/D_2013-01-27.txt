“International Holocaust Remembrance Day is about remembering and never forgetting.  On January 27, 1945 Soviet troops liberated the extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The atrocities at Auschwitz and across Europe that were committed by the Nazi regime cost the lives of 11 million people -- 6 million of them Jews -- none deserving such an end.  “On this anniversary, and every day, the world community grieves for those who were lost and share in the anguish of the survivors whose lives were forever changed. We also remember and honor all those who took risks and stood against Hitler, many of whom sacrificed their own lives on behalf of others.  “We all know too well the horrors of the Holocaust and we cannot stand by as other, modern-day genocides occur.  I am determined to make sure that such a dark history never repeats.  We owe the victims and their families our united resolve to prevent future crimes against humanity.”         ###

I joined Executive Director Joanne Piscitello today for a tour of the facility, which will offer all-inclusive care for seniors and older adults who want to stay in their homes, but need a little more care. The goal of this facility is to prevent hospital stays - decreasing health care costs in the long run.
