The state legislature voted to restrict womenâ€™s reproductive rights. Tammy believes women in Wisconsin deserve better!  Like and share if you agree.
Had a great time marching with One Colorado at Pridefest today. Keep up the great work everyone.
Looking forward to walking with One Colorado today in Denver's Pride Parade. It has been a historic year for our LGBT community in Colorado, thanks in large part to the hard work of groups like One Colorado. Although there is still work to be done, we have much to be proud of.
Today marks the one-year anniversary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which has given relief from deportation to countless numbers of hard-working young people who came to this country as children and know no other home. The plight of these DREAMers is one of many reasons why we need to fix our broken immigration system.
Yesterday, I joined the United States Marine Corps, members of the Shiloh Baptist Church and members of the Lee Family in Wilmington to present a Congressional Gold Medal to the family of Mr. Odell Lee, a Montford Point Marine who never received his medal before he passed away. He was a decorated Marine, hard working business owner and community member, and first and foremost, a great father. Happy Father's Day to all of the dads with us and also to those we hold in our hearts.
Happy Father's Day! I was blessed with a great dad, and am grateful every day for my husband, who is a wonderful father to our two children.
Wishing every father a very Happy Father's Day!
