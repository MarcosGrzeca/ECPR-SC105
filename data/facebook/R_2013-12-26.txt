Wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas. Especially thinking of our nation's servicemen and women who are stationed around the world this holiday season - our thoughts are with you and your families.
Happy Boxing Day!
While we enjoy the holidays with our families we can reflect with gratitude on those brave Americans who risked life and limb to cross the Delaware with General Washington 237 years ago today.  Their heroism won the freedom we enjoy today, and we owe it to their memory to defend it.
Merry Christmas!

Skiing with my son Matt at Alyeska on a cold clear Christmas Day. We were at the top of the lift at 1:30 pm just as the sun was going behind the mountain for the end of the day.  Our family enjoyed a nice morning at the cabin opening gifts before getting outside for a few hours of skiing. We will spend the evening with sisters and cousins and nephews and friends, thankful for all that we have. On this evening of the day we celebrate the birth of Christ let us be thankful of the many blessings that we have and the love of family. From our home to yours, Merry Christmas!
Even with partisan gridlock in Washington, my efforts have focused on helping Ohio. Check out 2013 Accomplishments below:
