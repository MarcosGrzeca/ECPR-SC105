Many from Wyoming and across the country have expressed concern about a congressional pay raise in these tough economic times. The pay raises were authorized by an executive order that President Obama signed last Friday and would increase the salaries of members of Congress and federal workers. However, one of the provisions in the fiscal cliff deal blocks any congressional raises for the next fiscal year (which ends in September).   In the last Congress, I cosponsored the No Budget No Pay Act, S.1981, which would have prohibited members of Congress from being paid until a budget was agreed to by both the House and the Senate. It also would have prohibited retroactive pay for any such period. Senator Dean Heller, R-Nev., plans to reintroduce the bill this Congress and I plan to be an original cosponsor.
