This past week I had the chance to visit some hard working Delawareans at the Delaware City Refinery and the Delaware Fire School. I'm impressed and inspired by the hard work and dedication of these men and women. I've invited people across the First State to share the important work they're doing on Twitter with the hashtag #DelawareWorks. Check out some of their stories at http://bit.ly/delawareworks and join the conversation!
Today is Gold Star Motherâ€™s Day, and I encourage all West Virginians to take a moment to honor the sacrifices of the mothers and families who have lost loved ones in defense of our country. Let today be a reminder to us all that the freedoms and liberties we enjoy come at a steep cost. On behalf of our entire state, I express my unconditional gratitude for the Gold Star Families across West Virginia and our great country.
Every year, Utica's Sts. Cosmas & Damian Celebration attracts hundreds to the city's East side to worship & enjoy Italian traditions, like these Utica pasticciotti.

As humans we are tied to place. We remember exactly where we were when we caught that first trout, or that first peak we climbed. We can not let those treasured places be sold to the highest bidder. #KeepItPublic
