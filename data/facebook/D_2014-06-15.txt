Happy #FathersDay to all. Special thanks to all the dads who are serving this nation overseas today.
Today, June 15th, Delaware celebrates its 238 year independence from both Pennsylvania and the British Crown. Happy Separation Day!
On Father’s Day, I must write a personal post to say how grateful I am to have such wonderful children.   Rob Jr. & Alicia: I’m so proud of the man & woman you’ve become. I love you
Happy father’s day to all of the hard-working dads!
This week I visited Hartford's North End to hear from community leaders about the importance of mentorship for young people in their area. These men are leading by example and proving that fatherhood comes in many shapes and forms. #HappyFathersDay
"My father was strength, humor, patience, and support. He gave me permission and passion for speaking out strongly, even as a young girl. I owe him so much. I miss him so much." -Claire  (Picture: Bill and Betty Anne McCaskill at a Mizzou formal dance.)  Happy Father's Day to all fathers - who like Bill McCaskill - encourage their children to pursue their dreams.
I've always loved this photo. 
Wishing fathers and families a happy Father's Day today!
