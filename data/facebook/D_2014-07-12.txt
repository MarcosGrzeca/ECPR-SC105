Discussing the importance of the Southwest Chief route with Amtrak President and CEO Joe Boardman.
Today I met with the new 91st Missile Wing Commander Colonel Michael Lutton at Minot Air Force Base to reiterate that I will continue to do all I can  in the U.S. Senate to make sure he and his fellow servicemembers have the support they need. I also met with veterans in Bottineau to discuss ways to improve health care and other services for veterans who live in rural areas. 
What better way to enjoy Oregon than hiking the beautiful coast?
The Oregon Caves National Monument is an amazing Oregon treasure, and this bill ensures that we can protect the caves and surrounding land for generations to come. The legislation will strengthen local communities in southwest Oregon, boost state tourism and help restore our forests. 
Happy #FrenchConnectionDay to @BuffaloSabres fans everywhere. First one ever! #buffalo #sabres
