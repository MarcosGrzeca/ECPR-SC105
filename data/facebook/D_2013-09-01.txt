Sitting down for an interview on @msnbc. Will be discussing Syria, look for it to air at 330 ET.
I strongly support the President’s decision to seek congressional approval of military action in response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons. Our nation is stronger in military matters when we act in a united fashion. The opportunity to fully debate this difficult situation will help educate the American public about the important issues at stake and ultimately provide a political consensus that our servicemembers must be able to rely on.
Yesterday, Senator Brian Schatz issued the following statement regarding Congressional consultation on military action in Syria.   “Friday, I stated the importance of the full participation of the United States Congress with respect to proposed military action in Syria.  Today, President Obama has taken the proper step in announcing that he will seek Congressional authorization before taking military action.   "Congress must weigh in. And this decision should spur an important debate, allowing us to review the facts. Most importantly, this assures the country that the gravity of taking military action is weighed fully before decisions are made. I will continue to participate in briefings with the President’s senior national security advisors and reviewing relevant intelligence in order to give this decision the serious consideration it deserves."
