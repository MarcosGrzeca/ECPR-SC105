An interesting development. Definitely worth sharing. #EndExIm
It was great to give remarks at a Kansas Optometric Association meeting this morning at the K-State Alumni Center. I spoke about the importance of getting involved in your community and recruiting and retaining health care providers in rural America. We also had a discussion about Obamacare and the economy, as well as student loans and the cost of higher education. Thanks to Kansas Optometric Association's Dr. Todd Fleischer for the invitation to speak.
Today I spoke at a meeting with about 40 Manhattan-area veterans. We discussed the importance of access to health care for vets in rural communities, the Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Nominee Bob McDonald, the shortage of physicians and medical staff in rural communities, and the claims and appeals process. I will continue to work to make certain veterans receive the best quality care from an agency that is worthy of their service.
How are you spending your Friday night? I'm back in Hays for the Ellis County Fair. I stopped by the 4-H Livestock Sale and then visited with the Walters family. Here, I'm pictured with Nate, his parents Marty and Anita, and his siblings Joe and Katy. Nate is a member of the Buckeye Junior Farmers 4-H Club and was awarded Grand Champion for his arts and crafts project, "Suit of Armour."
Before I left Texas from my trip to examine the situation on the border first-hand, I wanted to share my thoughts and observations with Alaska.
