Today, the USS North Dakota nuclear submarine was commissioned in a ceremony in Connecticut. This is truly a proud day for our state, and this boat will play an integral part of our national defense. Today, we honor the people who built the USS North Dakota, the sailors who will sail her, and all the North Dakotans who have bravely served our nation throughout the years. http://1.usa.gov/1nEClnH
