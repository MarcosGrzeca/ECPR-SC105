Yesterday’s raid on Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (RFE/RL’s) #Baku bureau continues the recent and deeply disturbing trend of the government of #Azerbaijan to silence dissenting voices within the country, and comes on the heels of the recent arrest and pre-trial detention of Khadija #Ismayilova, an investigative journalist and contributor to RFE/RL’s #Azerbaijani Service.  Once again, we call on the Azerbaijani authorities to immediately end their harassment of journalists and to respect the commitments they have made in the past, as a participating State in the OSCE – The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
