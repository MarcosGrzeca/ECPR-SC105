Happy 192nd birthday, Missouri!
Have had some great events and saw many friends throughout north Idaho. Today, I flew down to Boise and drove out to Emmett to visit with the "Downwinders'." "Downwinders'" have various health issues caused by radiation from nuclear arms testing that drifted east & north over a number of states.
As a cancer survivor, it meant a lot to join in the Survivorâ€™s lap at the @RelayForLife event. What an inspiration. #idpol #HOPE

It is unacceptable that Illinois #veterans now have to wait more than 500 days for the VA to process their disability claims. The President and Congress should act without delay to enact the reforms Senator Tim Johnson and I proposed so we can keep our promise to the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country.

We owe it to returning #veterans to help with the VA claims process, get them their benefits quickly, and help them find #jobs.
I was glad to be in Victoria this morning to join so many great folks at the Herzogfest. This free annual event celebrates Victoria's German heritage and has something fun for the entire family - from an antique tractor pull to kids games and live music. The event will cap off with a large fireworks display this evening. If you're in the area, be sure to stop by. Thanks again to Jerry Freitag for driving me in the parade.
My thanks to U.S. Forest Chief Tom Tidwell for spending the last two days with me traveling and touring the Tongass.  It was my goal to show him the beauty and remoteness of this famous forest and introduce him to the Alaskans who depend on it.  His job is not just about management of the trees, it's also about management of the economy of much of Southeast, and I know he will leave our state with a better understanding of both.
The President's energy policies are hurting the American people. I gave the Weekly GOP Address today on the importance of an all of the above energy strategy.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUP55-EMTdY&feature=share&list=UUOKW-o3oYdFmrMNcTLVuaoA
Earlier today, my Western PA regional manager Katelyn King, participated at the annual Veterans Stand Down event in Pittsburgh.  The Veterans Stand Down event is held at Shepherd's Heart and brings together numerous service agencies in order to assist homeless veterans.
