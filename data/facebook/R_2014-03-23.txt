Four years ago today, #Obamacare was signed into law and now Americans everywhere are experiencing its harm. Obamacare has led to increased costs, canceled plans and fewer choices in doctors and hospitals. The reality of Obamacare is not what was promised, and after four years the American people want no more of it.
Religious liberty means not having "underground" clergy die under house arrest. Bishop Joseph Fan was a giant in the battle for religious liberty in China.
Another great win by our Wisconsin Badgers! On Wisconsin!
What often passes for compromise in Washington isn't really compromise at all.
On the four-year anniversary of Obamacare, we see higher premiums & fewer choices. Share your Obamacare story with me. 
Senator Rubio Marks 4th Anniversary Of Failed ObamaCare Law: http://1.usa.gov/1rgUAOM  “But what has happened and has changed about ObamaCare is it’s no longer something people are hearing about on the news, it’s something that they’re now feeling in their lives,” Rubio said. “ObamaCare has gone from being something political, to something personal.   “Personal because now people can no longer continue to see the doctors they’ve been seeing for a long time. They can no longer continue to go to the specialty center that is caring for them. They’ve lost the health insurance they were happy with. They’re paying higher premiums, or a much higher deductible. Maybe it’s cost them their job, maybe it’s cost them hours at work or maybe they’re suffering from all of the above,” Rubio added. “That’s why we cannot give up on our efforts, not just to completely repeal ObamaCare, but to replace it with real market-based solutions that allow every single American to have the ability to buy affordable health insurance that meets their needs, and to buy it from any company in America that will sell it to them. We’re going to have a chance to achieve that soon. We cannot give up.”
