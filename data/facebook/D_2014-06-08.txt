After I brought the Federal Aviation Administration head to North Dakota in April, it's no secret that I've been pushing the FAA to invest in North Dakota's airports so the facilities can accommodate our state's growing demand for air travel. Today we're celebrating the completion of renovated runway at the Mandan Airport that will help support our growing aviation industry and economic development. Just in the past few months, more than $20 million have been invested in airports around the state. http://www.heitkamp.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=4c9bda1a-3486-42ab-8ef9-79ec5664ad95
These guys had a great idea in 2011, and now, #GovBallNYC  founders Yoni, Tom & Jordan can say they've created a New York tradition.
Great to have Danza Fiesta here at the Puerto Rican Day Parade!
