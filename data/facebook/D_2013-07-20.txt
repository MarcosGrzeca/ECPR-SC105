Spent the morning volunteering at the Remote Area Medical (RAM) clinic in Wise County – such an important event serving more than 3,000 of patients this year. The RAM clinic highlights the amazing volunteerism and spirit of doctors and nurses who provide care to those in need and reminds us of how much work there is to be done to increase access to health care.
LIKE this photo if you think corporate America should stand up and say what they pay.   Good news report: The SEC will take a real step forward to require that public companies disclose just how much more their CEO’s are paid than rank-and-file workers.      I wrote this simple requirement that became part of Wall Street Reform 3 years ago because while middle class Americans have gone years without seeing a raise, there’s no doubt CEO pay is soaring. But corporations have fought against sharing this. Why? Maybe they don’t want shareholders to know just how much more the boss makes.
SHAHEEN, COLLINS SCORE CRITICAL FISHERY DISASTER RELIEF IN APPROPRIATIONS BILL: Good news for New Hampshire fishermen due in part to the bipartisan efforts of Senator Shaheen and Senator Susan Collins.
It was great to hear from enthusiastic local supporters of President Obama's climate change plan yesterday at the Ocean Mist bar. We’ve all seen how coastal erosion and sea level rise is affecting the Ocean Mist. It’s time to fight back against the effects of climate change to protect this and other RI businesses. I applaud the President for taking steps that will help RI's coastal economy.
