Great to be home for the second expansion of the Brewer Science at Missouri State University’s Jordan Valley Innovation Center today. I’m very pleased that this second expansion will continue to bring economic growth to Southwest Missouri and grow private sector jobs across Missouri.
I'm looking forward to joining Senator Bob Casey tomorrow on Fox News Sunday at 8 am MT on your local FOX station. It will be re-broadcast on FOX News Channel at 12 pm MT and 4 pm MT.

This morning before heading back to Washington, I hosted another town hall meeting in Dickinson County at the Chapman Senior Center. More than 20 elected officials, veterans and community members from Abilene, Maple Hill, Gypsum and around the area traveled to Chapman to discuss a number of issues facing Kansas and the country. Our conversation centered around water regulation, the Lesser Prairie Chicken, veterans' affairs, IRS, Ft. Riley, immigration and Obamacare. It was good to hear the community is growing. Thanks to Thelma Lexow for helping to coordinate the meeting.
Hope everyone has had a wonderful July 4th. Our daughter Kelsey  is on the National Mall as part of the crowd of Americans celebrating our country's birth. Thanks for the opportunity to work in our nation's capital on your behalf. Our responsibility as citizens is to preserve our Constitutional freedoms and to keep the American Dream alive for this generation and for future generations. God bless America.
Hope everyone had a great, patriotic 4th of July!  My family and I had a fun one, watching the parade in Wrangell!
Go Reds! Good to be at the ballpark with Jane tonight rooting on my team.
No surprise here: South Carolina was recently ranked the most patriotic state in the nation!  http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/south-carolina/2014/07/02/sc-tops-list-patriotic-state/12044193/
