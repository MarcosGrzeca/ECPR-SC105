Recently, I joined the new police chief Norman Wood to help announce a USDA Rural Development loan to the Smyrna Police Department to help build its new facility â€“ bringing its force under one roof. This will ultimately help them better serve and protect the Smyrna community.
Congratulations to the Mountain Ridge Little League team for making Nevada so proud. Best wishes in Williamsport!
