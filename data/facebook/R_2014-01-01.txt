The Obama Administration's HHS mandate is an egregious and blatant violation of the religious freedom that Americans have enjoyed for more than 220 years since the ratification of the First Amendment. No American should be forced to surrender their religious freedom or abandon their deeply held religious beliefs. I applaud Justice Sotomayor's move to block this onerous government overreach, which violates Americansâ€™ constitutional rights.
