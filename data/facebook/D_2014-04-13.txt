Great evening at the inaugural Indy Eleven game.
Today, I join with all Rhode Islanders in mourning the loss of an extraordinary woman, Nuala Pell.  She had a timeless elegance and charm and was just a beautiful person.    It was truly an honor to know both Nuala and Claiborne Pell.  I will be forever grateful for their enduring friendship, leadership, and devotion to our great state.  Together, they touched so many lives and helped so many individuals.   Nuala Pell worked hard to give others opportunity and she did it with incredible grace, decency, and compassion.  A civic leader in her own right, Nuala was a spirited champion of the arts, education, and public service.  Her lifetime commitment to service and generous contributions to our community will continue to impact countless lives.   I extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Nuala Pell.  Her legacy of kindness, generosity, and working to expand opportunity for others will continue to live on.
Just met the sculptor of the Charging Bull in Bowling Green, Arturo Di Modica
