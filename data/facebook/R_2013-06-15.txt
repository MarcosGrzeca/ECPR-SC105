Congrats to my friend, former Governor Phil Batt. The Idaho Transportation Department Headquarters was named in his honor. My staff attended the ceremony.
Regrettably, enforcement of law is exclusive province of executive branch, i.e., Holder and WH, so those hoping for enforcement of our immigration laws, including border security, will have a 3 1/2 yr wait till they are gone.
I'm excited to be back in Nebraska for the 2013 College World Series of Omaha, Inc., going 63 years strong. Good luck to all the teams and welcome to the great state of Nebraska!
My office is currently accepting applications for internships in Nebraska and in Washington, DC. This experience offers an opportunity for interested Nebraskans to learn first-hand about the legislative process and Senate operations. The form to submit an application is available on my website. Please mail this form to any one of my offices by July 15 to apply for an internship this fall.

Good conversations with Kansans this morning at Summerfest in Frankfort, Kansas. Here, I'm pictured with Trent Kennedy, Lucas Adams and Jake Rose. Trent spent the spring semester in Washington, D.C., as a United States Senate Page, and his community honored him as the Summerfest Parade Grand Marshal.  I look forward to welcoming Frankfort High School juniors to Washington next week when they visit the nation's capital.
Great to be at Anderson University today to meet and speak with the newest Palmetto Boys' State graduates and their families!
