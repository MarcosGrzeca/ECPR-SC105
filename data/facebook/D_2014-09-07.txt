Happy National Grandparents Day to all of the proud West Virginia grandparents. Gayle and I are so blessed to have eight beautiful grandchildren, Kelsey, Joey, Madeline, Chloe, Sophie, Jack, Carly and Vivian. Here are just a few of my favorite moments with some of them. National Grandparents Day was founded by Marian McQuade of Oak Hill, West Virginia in 1978 and will continue to be a testament to West Virginiansâ€™ commitment and love for our families.
Congrats to runners, walkers, family & friends who came out today for #RaceForACure
