From my family to yours, #happyholidays. I send special thanks to the men and women away from their families this time of year-protecting our communities and serving our country.
Wishing everyone a safe, healthy, and merry Christmas! I hope Santa was good to you this year! #tbt
From my family to yours, have a very blessed Christmas. –Joe
As families travel from far and wide to come together around this time of year, I hope you also take a moment to give back by visiting folks at your local senior center, volunteering your time and energy at a food bank or homeless shelter, giving a gift for an Angel Tree, or donating some of the clothes you no longer wear. There are countless ways to give back to your community. As North Dakotans, we know that times can sometimes be tough. We have faced severe winters, crop losses, and economic stresses. But we also know the importance of resilience – because we always come out on top. But we can’t do it alone. We need the support of our family, friends, neighbors, and others in our communities. The holiday season is a particular reminder of that ethic to help a neighbor in need, and of why we are proud to be North Dakotans. Merry Christmas and happy holidays.
Warm wishes for a Merry Christmas from my family to yours!
I hope you’re all enjoying a peaceful Christmas Eve with your loved ones. Have a blessed night!
My 3 year old is playing with a new felt board and my 6 year old is already working on a new Star Wars lego. Merry Christmas from a happy Murphy house.
