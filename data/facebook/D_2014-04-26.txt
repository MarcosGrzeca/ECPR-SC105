I’m calling on all Delawareans to help put a stop to prescription drug abuse by ridding yourselves of expired, unused medication today during the 5th annual National Prescription Drug Take Back Day from 10-2. Using any of these 31 locations across the First State, it’s never been easier to discard your meds in a safe, responsible manner- http://1.usa.gov/1jLxZ67
Touring the Las Vegas veterans' clinic to find more ways we can overcome the challenges our veterans face in getting quality care at rural clinics. Our veterans have fought halfway around the world for our freedom, and we should go the extra mile for them. The Rural Veterans Improvement Act I've introduced will address many of the problems veterans face, such as the difficulty finding transportation to the VA hospital and high turnover among doctors and staff at rural clinics, and I'm going to continue fighting for more progress. The Las Vegas clinic is well-regarded, and we need to ensure all of New Mexico's veterans get the excellent care they have earned.
Very honored to participate in the ribbon cutting for the new Raton veterans' clinic this week. An upgraded facility has been needed for some time, and I was proud to fight alongside veterans in this community to get the project over the finish line. Improvements here will allow the clinic to increase its use of telehealth technology and reduce the distance veterans must travel for specialized care. All of our veterans in New Mexico deserve the best care possible - that's why I introduced the Rural Veterans Improvement Act, and why I'll continue fighting for adequate facilities, more staff and better services for our veterans all over the state and nation.
