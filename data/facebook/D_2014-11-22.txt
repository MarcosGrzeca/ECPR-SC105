We have new start-ups all over North Dakota, and great organizations that are helping support new entrepreneurs. For Global Entrepreneurship Week, I want to recognize the great work being done by Emerging Prairie in Fargo to foster a supportive environment for start-ups. North Dakota is home to smart and ambitious professionals, and building an environment that encourages entrepreneurs to grow starts-ups here will help our state remain on the cutting edge of innovation well into the future. As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I’ll keep pushing to make sure our small businesses and start-ups have the tools they need to grow. #GEW2014

On National Adoption Day, I want to thank my 2013 and 2014 Angels in Adoption, Courtney and Bobby Williams of Dickinson and Ina Olson of Belcourt, and all of North Dakota’s adoptive parents, who each and every day, have a positive impact on the lives of adopted children.
Join me this Sunday in Litchfield at 4:00pm for a town hall at the Litchfield Intermediate School. I'll be taking your questions on foreign policy and discussing topics ranging from the situation in Ukraine to our efforts to combat ISIL in Syria. Hope to see you there.
