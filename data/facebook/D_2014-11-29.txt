On this #smallbizsat I'm proud to serve on the Senate Small Business Committee Democrats and to #shopsmall in #FellsPoint.
I encourage shoppers to buy local not only today - Small Business Saturday - but any day throughout the year. I had a great time shopping in downtown Milford this week and meeting the owners of the shops in its vibrant downtown.
In North Dakota, small businesses employ nearly 183,000 workers and represent 96% of all employers – they are the backbone of North Dakota’s economy. When I visit towns across the state, I try to stop by the local restaurants and stores that have become staples in our communities, like Dakota Harvest, Dave Badman's Design and Waterfront Kitchen & Bath in Grand Forks, to show my support and thank them for their commitment to helping our communities and state thrive. Today, for Small Business Saturday, help support our small businesses by shopping at locally.
Ortega's Weaving Shop in Chimayo is a great example of the many small businesses across NM that keep our economy strong. And I learned a lot about their craft today in my visit to highlight #smallbizsat #shopsmall
Happy Small Business Saturday! Today, join me in supporting small local businesses by shopping at ones like those here in Pawtuxet Village. It's the perfect day to #ShopSmall & #DineSmall. #SmallBizSat
