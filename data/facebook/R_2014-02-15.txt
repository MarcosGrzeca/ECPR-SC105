Consumer warning - scam targeting Maine businesses.
Tonight, the employees at the Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga voted against representation by the United Auto Workers union. Needless to say, I am thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and its future.   As mayor of Chattanooga from 2001-2005, we worked with officials and community leaders to develop the 1,200 acre Enterprise South Industrial Park, which is now the location of Volkswagen's North American manufacturing headquarters. Much of the negotiation that led to Volkswagen choosing Chattanooga occurred around my dining room table at our home in Chattanooga.

Secretary of State John Kerry today sent me a letter informing me he plans to name a 'Special Assistant for the Arctic Region' soon. That sounds like a positive development for the U.S. as we try and make the Arctic a national priority, but 7 of the 8 Arctic nations have official ambassador-level officials in this important region, and I believe America should have one, too.

As Sebelius Visits Miami & Orlando, Senator Rubio Presses For Answers On ObamaCare Bailouts & Medicare Cuts To Seniors: http://1.usa.gov/1dSTBKo  ...  “Secretary Sebelius should not expect to leave Florida without addressing the potential for a taxpayer-funded bailout under ObamaCare and anticipated Medicare Advantage cuts for over a million Florida seniors,” said Rubio. “Secretary Sebelius should explain why she believes ObamaCare is so great that it’s worth bailing out insurance companies to save it and cutting existing benefits under Medicare Advantage to fund it.   “Rather than wait for next Friday afternoon’s predictable bad news dump, Secretary Sebelius should be up front with Florida’s seniors about what awaits them this fall: higher out-of-pocket costs, limited doctor choices and scaled back benefits,” added Rubio. 
Way to go Sarah!
