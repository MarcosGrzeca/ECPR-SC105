After website works: Cancelations, sticker shock (premiums, deductibles, co-pays), limits on drs and hospitals, higher taxes… .

On CBS’ “Face the Nation” today, Senator Corker said Americans will likely experience a lot of “negative surprises” as they continue to enroll in Obamacare.  “We all get calls from incredibly distressed citizens who have had their policies cancelled yet are unable to enroll in a new plan….At the end of the day, while there will be a few winners, most Americans are going to find a less dynamic health system, and they're going to find that the cost of the health care they're able to purchase is going to be a lot higher.  They're also going to realize that their choices are far less,” said Corker.  “Unfortunately as people enroll I think there's going to be a lot of negative surprises as to what they're able to enroll in.” More available here: http://1.usa.gov/1iqdKjc.

A faulty website is but one symptom of Obamacare. Others include increased premiums, cancelled plans and decreased access to your doctor.   A cure is available though: #FullRepeal
