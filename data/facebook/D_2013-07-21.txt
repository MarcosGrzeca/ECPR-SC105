I enjoy having the help of so many young North Dakotans in all my offices.  Please check out my website if you are interested in interning for the people of North Dakota and thanks to Michael for all his hard work!
I had a great time joining the mountain music jam session at the Floyd Country Store! We even mixed it up and played some gospel.
