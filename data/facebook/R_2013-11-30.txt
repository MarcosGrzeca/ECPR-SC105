Today, I held my last Kansas Listening Tour stop of the week in Morris County at the community building in Dwight. This was my 1,003rd town hall and each conversation I have with Kansans impacts the decisions I make in Washington, D.C. Attendees asked about a variety of issues including Obamacare, rural development and the Farm Bill.
This weekend, people around the country began shopping for the holidays. This season is always a much-needed boost to retail businesses, especially for small businesses â€” the backbone of our economy. If you're out shopping today, Small Business Saturday, I encourage you to support small businesses to help fuel the economy. But I also hope folks will continue supporting their Main Street businesses throughout the year. Shopping local is a great way to say thanks to the business owners and employees who strengthen our communities.
