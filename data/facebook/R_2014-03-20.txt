In a separate story from WTVD -- “across the state, employers are trying to get their arms around what the new health care law will mean, both for their bottom line and their workers, specifically their part-time workers.”
In case you missed it, I joined WTVD’s Larry Stogner in studio this week.
Thanks to the folks at Bentley Plastics in Perryville for giving us a tour and showing us some great products that are made in America.
We had a great time talking with students at Morrilton High School this morning. Thanks for the warm welcome.
Starting the day off in Morrilton at the new 911 center in Conway County. Appreciate Morrilton Mayor Stewart Nelson and Conway County Judge Jimmy Heart sharing their time to show me this new facility.
While I’m disappointed that I won’t be able to go on vacation with my family in Siberia this summer, I am honored to be on this list. Putin’s recent aggression is unacceptable, and America must join with our European allies to isolate and punish Russia. I will continue to lead efforts on Capitol Hill to bring Putin to his senses.

To the people of Iran I say happy new year, and send my hopes it will bring you the political and religious liberty you deserve.  America stands ready to welcome a free and peaceful Iran into a mutually-beneficial friendship.  While Saeed Abedini, an American citizen, languishes in a brutal Iranian prison for the peaceful profession of his Christian faith, however, there should be no illusions that the regime of Hasan Rouhani is any more "moderate" than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The case of Pastor Saeed demonstrates the grim reality that under the genial veneer of cell phone chats and tweets, the cruelly oppressive and anti-American policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei are unchanged.  Pastor Saeed is, unfortunately, only one piece in the larger picture of human rights abuses in Iran.  Not only are he and his fellow Americans Amir Hekmati and Robert Levinson detained in Iran, but the regime has also increased its oppression of its own people.  Just this month, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation on human rights in Iran submitted a report detailing how the human rights crisis has worsened--not improved--since Rouhani's election, including spikes in executions and abuses of religious freedom.  Some in the Obama administration believe human rights issues can be compartmentalized, or rather marginalized, in their quest to get a comprehensive deal on Iran's nuclear program, and the administration has shown little interest in officially naming Iranian human rights abusers for sanctions.  I believe this is a mistake, and that we should be aggressively pursuing human rights abusers in Iran as we should in Russia.  At the very least the United States should demand the release of our unjustly detained citizens before we embrace a hostile foreign government as a legitimate diplomatic partner.   There could be no more positive step for both our countries than if all prisoners of conscience in Iran were immediately and unconditionally released on Nowruz, beginning with Saeed Abedini, and I urge all those observing the holiday to remember him in their prayers. #SaveSaeed
It is the height of hypocrisy for the Obama Administration to claim that the investigator leading the investigation into the #IRS's illegal targeting program has no conflict of interest.
Honored to tour Goodfellow Air Force Base and thank all those who selflessly put their lives on the line to defend our nation and our liberties!
Terrific conversation with Midland business leaders about the Great American Energy Renaissance that is at our fingertips.
Economic prosperity at home goes hand in hand with strong leadership in the world. It's time to get the American economy booming again.

Margaret May was born at 11:54 p.m. and Bryan Carl arrived at 12:13 a.m. (twins with different birthdays!). All are healthy and happy. We feel thankful and truly blessed to celebrate the arrival of these precious children to our family.

Read my letter calling for cost of living adjustment for civilian federal employees working in Minot and western North Dakota. I am committed to fair pay for federal employees in Minot and throughout the western part of North Dakota. I have asked the Air Force to look for ways to increase compensation for its employees, and I understand that the Department of Defense is looking for ways to pay its civilians in the area on a competitive basis. I have also spoken to the head of the Office of Personnel Management on this issue. I hope the Federal Salary Council can make recommendations that will contribute to this effort.  http://www.hoeven.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2014/3/hoeven-calls-for-cost-of-living-adjustment-for-civilian-federal-workers-in-minot-and-western-north-dakota

On Wisconsin! Nice win!
Congratulations to Sophia Weiss and Paige Courtney, 11th graders at Lakeland Union High School in Minocqua, for winning a third prize in  C-SPAN 's C-SPAN StudentCam Video Documentary Competition. You can see their examination of how corporate tax reform would help northern Wisconsin below.   Their questions show real understanding of economics and the effect of government on people.   Congratulations, too, to the honorable mentions won by Sarah Prusha, an 11th grader at Slinger High School for her video on criminal justice reform, and by Justin Wilcox, a senior at South Shore High School in Port Wing, for his video on the economy.
UN report reminds us about the true nature of the #Iran regime: Islamic radicals who persecute Christians, Baha'is, other religious and ethnic minorities and women, while denying all of its citizens basic human rights.
Yesterday I was invited to visit the Center for Constitutional Studies at Utah Valley University.  One of the topics I discussed with the students was the importance of the Constitution's vertical and horizontal separation of powers.  Naturally, I posed with several attendees of the event in front of a picture of Montesquieu, whose ideas informed the importance of separation of powers in our Constitution.  This quote from Montesquieu is as relevant today as it was in the 1700s: "When legislative power is united with executive power in a single person or in a simple body of magistracy, there is no liberty, because one can fear that the same monarch or senate that makes tyrannical laws will execute them tyrannically."  What are your favorite quotes from Montesquieu?
On being sanctioned by Russian President Vladimir Putin:  I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off, my Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea.
It was good to be in The Little Apple today and give Rotary Club members a legislative update on a number or issues including economic development, Fort Riley, FAA Control Towers, the importance of health care in our community and technology. I also had the opportunity to catch up with my friend and K-State Professor Emeritus Barry Flinchbaugh. Dr. Flinchbaugh is a leading authority in agriculture policy. Thanks to Manhattan Chamber President and CEO and Rotarian Lyle Butler for the introduction.
Wednesday, my Kansas Listening Tour continued in Butler County at the El Dorado Chamber of Commerce.

I know a lot of Alaskans are concerned about the price increase for mailing Standard Post (Parcel Post) boxes and how it has affected shipping in and out of off-road Alaskan communities.  Today the Post Office announced that come Sunday, March 23rd, the new Limited Overland Routes pricing category goes into effect.  That means if you are sending packages from or to any of the zip codes below, the rates should be the same as they were before the January price increase.  99545 99546 99547 99548 99549 99550 99551 99552 99553 99554 99555 99557 99558 99559 99561 99563 99564 99565 99569 99571 99574 99575 99576 99578 99579 99580 99581 99583 99585 99589 99590 99591 99602 99604 99606 99607 99608 99609 99612 99613 99614 99615 99619 99620 99621 99622 99624 99625 99626 99627 99628 99630 99632 99633 99634 99636 99637 99638 99640 99641 99643 99644 99647 99648 99649 99650 99651 99653 99655 99656 99657 99658 99659 99660 99661 99662 99663 99665 99666 99667 99668 99670 99671 99675 99677 99678 99679 99680 99681 99682 99684 99685 99689 99690 99691 99692 99695 99697 99720 99721 99722 99723 99724 99726 99727 99730 99732 99733 99734 99736 99738 99739 99740 99741 99742 99745 99746 99747 99748 99749 99750 99751 99752 99753 99754 99756 99757 99758 99759 99761 99762 99763 99765 99766 99767 99768 99769 99770 99771 99772 99773 99774 99777 99778 99781 99782 99783 99784 99785 99786 99788 99789 99790 99791 99801 99802 99803 99811 99812 99820 99821 99824 99825 99826 99827 99829 99830 99832 99833 99835 99836 99840 99841 99850 99901 99903 99918 99919 99921 99922 99923 99925 99926 99927 99928 99929 99950
