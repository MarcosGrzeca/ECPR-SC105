Today is a great day for the United States of America.   The safe return of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl is an answer to the prayers of the Bergdahl family and a powerful reinforcement of our nationâ€™s commitment to leave no service member behind.   I commend the diplomats, service members, and others who worked tirelessly to bring Sergeant Bergdahl home, and I commend President Obama for taking decisive action to achieve the agreement leading to his release when the opportunity arose. The President rightly recognized our solemn obligation to take every possible measure to protect and defend the men and women who serve our nation.
