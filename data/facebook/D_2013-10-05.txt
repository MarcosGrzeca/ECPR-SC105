The solution for immigration reform is the same as it is for shutdown -- the House needs to vote! #TimeIsNow http://youtu.be/LGrcpdQh7L4
Speaker Boehner is a good man who has a tough job. But can anyone explain to me why he refuses to allow a vote on the Senate-passed bill to end the shutdown?
Today, the House Republicans passed uncontroversial legislation to give backpay to federal workers once the government reopens. Of course, we agree with this legislation and will support it. But it’s cruel to tell these workers that they’ll receive backpay once the government reopens, but then refuse to open the government!  Republicans still have yet to vote on our Senate bill which would reopen the government today. The government is shut down because Speaker Boehner refuses to let the House vote on a bill that was HIS IDEA!
House voted 407-0 this morning to provide backpay to furloughed federal workers when the shutdown ends. We introduced identical legislation in the Senate with U.S. Senator Tim Kaine & Senator Ben Cardin and U.S. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland. Let's pass this ASAP!
