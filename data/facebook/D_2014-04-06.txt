Cheers all over #CT for Husky heroes! Great ball players, and people - they worked hard and won well. 
It was a great honor last week to welcome Dover High's Courtney Voshell to DC. She was recently named National Assistant Principal of the Year by the National Association of Secondary School Principals. Good to know the kids in Dover are in the hands of the best! Congrats Courtney!
