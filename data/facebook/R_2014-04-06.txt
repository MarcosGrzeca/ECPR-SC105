During my time in Kansas over the weekend, it was good to visit with community leaders from Franklin County. The county, city of Ottawa, school board, main street, chamber and development council had a joint meeting to discuss ways to improve economic development. I commend these Kansans for working together to improve the communities they call home, as well as make certain their children may return to raise families of their own. It was great to meet these community leaders and offer any help I may provide.
