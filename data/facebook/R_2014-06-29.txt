Tomorrow, President Obama is expected to nominate Bob McDonald to become the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I look forward to the opportunity to meet Mr. McDonald and discuss the ways he might change the VA's corrosive culture that currently treats veterans like a burden. During the confirmation process before the Senate VA Committee, I'll be eager to hear assurances of how the VA will restore the highest quality of care veterans deserve and create an agency that is worthy of their service.
On Friday, the long-awaited White House report on wrongdoing at the VA was released and it admitted what we've known all along: We need accountability and true reform within the VA all across the country. The White House is finally coming to terms with the reality of the systemic dysfunction at the VA and I am hopeful the damage control will now stop and the work to transform the VA will begin. I will continue to engage with VA leaders directly until this situation is resolved.
