There is severe weather expected in Indiana. Marsha and I are praying that all Hoosiers are safe during these storms. Here are some tips and resources to help you and your family prepare and stay informed:  -Decide in advance where you and your family will go during a tornado.   -Put as many walls and floors as possible between you and the storm.   -Subscribe to alerts so you can be notified of severe weather heading your way. The National Weather Service has a list of alert subscriptions here or you can subscribe to alerts through your local news stations. http://www.weather.gov/subscribe  -Follow FEMA on Twitter. https://twitter.com/FEMA  -Follow FEMA on Facebook. http://www.facebook.com/FEMA

While in Hays yesterday, Robba and I joined members of my staff to celebrate the marriage of Aaron and Chelsey Ladd. Chelsey assists Kansans who are experiencing difficulties with Social Security, Medicare, veteransâ€™ affairs or have other concerns regarding federal issues. Congrats!
Today, while home in Anchorage, I stopped by the School Counselor Association Conference to talk about some of the tough stuff our kids are dealing with these days: bullying, new learning challenges -- and especially youth suicide.

While there are no easy answers,  I know it is going to take all of us coming together to figure out how to stop this.
Today Senator Moran and I had the opportunity to visit with 250 members of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in Overland Park about the safety and security of both the United States and Israel.
