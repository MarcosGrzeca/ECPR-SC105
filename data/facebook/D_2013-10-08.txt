Following reports that the Department of Defense would not be able to pay death gratuities to families of service members killed in combat, I worked with the CEO of the Fisher House Foundation, Ken Fisher, to make sure these families are taken care of in their time of greatest need.

The Fisher House will also cover flights, hotels and other incidentals for family members.

This is what happens every time we've asked Republicans to enter into a budget conference so that we negotiate our differences.
Democrats negotiated with Republicans and struck a very difficult compromise for us. But now that Democrats have compromised, Speaker Boehner wonâ€™t take yes for an answer. The Senate has voted on this; the House has not.
