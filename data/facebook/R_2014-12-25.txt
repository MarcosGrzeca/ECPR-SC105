Hope everyone has a great time celebrating with family and friends. Merry Christmas!
As we celebrate the holiday season with our friends and families, let us take a moment to say a special thank you to our country’s military heroes stationed and deployed around the world. These brave men and women defend our country and allies, often sacrificing spending time with their family and loved ones in order to keep us safe. We owe these heroes a debt of gratitude for keeping America safe. Please join me in saying thank you to our military heroes and their families this holiday season for all that they do so that we are able to enjoy the freedoms that make this nation great. #HappyHolidays
From my family to yours, we hope you have a safe and Merry Christmas and best wishes for a Happy New Year.

I hope you are enjoying a meaningful holiday season.  Despite the many challenges before us, we live in the greatest country in the world and have much for which to be thankful.  I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunity to tackle the big issues our country faces as we enter 2015 and reaffirm my commitment to all Tennesseans that I will continue to wake up every day working toward that end.  Elizabeth and I wish you and yours a very merry Christmas, and I look forward to serving you in the Senate in the new year.
