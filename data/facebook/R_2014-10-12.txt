Big day for Texas football!
Yesterday was the United Nations' "International Day of the Girl Child." This year's theme was "Empowering adolescent girls: Ending the cycle of violence." We cannot end the cycle of violence without addressing the practice of sex-selective abortion, which has disproportionately claimed the lives of millions of baby girls across the world.  Unfortunately, right here in America there are 36 Democrats in the Senate promoting the so-called "Women's Health Protection Act" which would nullify virtually all state and federal limits on abortion, including sex-selective abortion.  Every life is a precious gift from God, and even more so, targeting baby girls for death in the womb simply because they are the "wrong" sex is heartbreaking and wrong.

This afternoon, I had the privilege of congratulating six new Eagle Scouts in Leawood. To become an Eagle Scout, one must demonstrate his leadership, service and outdoor skills.    The Boy Scouts of America aims to develop responsible and engaged citizens. Through the Boy Scouts, young men are being equipped with skills that will help them become successful in life. I enjoyed being a part of this special ceremony and want to congratulate Isaac, William, Andrew, Calvin, Jacob and Dane on a job well done.
