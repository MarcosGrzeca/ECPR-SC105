Stopped by the Bismarck Century Blizzards game today. We put up their championship banner from winning the 2013 tournament and celebrated their hard work and commitment.
Today I stopped at Lot 2029 in Bismarck to do some holiday shopping. Glad I could support some of the many great small businesses today for Small Business Saturday.
Small businesses are the backbone of North Dakota’s economy, and the U.S. economy as a whole. In North Dakota, small businesses represent 96% of all employers, and they employ nearly 183,000 ND workers. Today, Small Business Saturday, is a day to support our local businesses by shopping at their stores and showing the huge impact they have on our communities. I’m going to go shopping in downtown Bismarck at some of the many great locally owned stores including Impact Gallery and Gifts, Bismarck Downtown Artist Co-op and Loft 2029, and I encourage all North Dakotans to do the same.
Our economy depends on the success of our small businesses. It's common sense – stronger small businesses equal more jobs. Encouraging all West Virginians to #ShopSmall today & support your local small businesses. #SmallBizSat #SmallBusinessSaturday
Today is Small Business Saturday. Remember to support local businesses.
