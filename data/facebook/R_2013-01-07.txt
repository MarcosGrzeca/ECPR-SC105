As the national debt continues to rise, each day wasted is a day closer to our country hitting its borrowing limit. Rather than take a break from the Capitol, congressional leaders should immediately call lawmakers back to Washington to begin working now on a long-term deficit reduction plan to address our unsustainable $16.4 trillion debt.
My column in the Indianapolis Star on Sunday
My friend from Michigan and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dave Camp, gave the GOP Weekly Address.  Our focus must be on the real problem and dealing with our debt and deficits. We must reduce spending, and reform our entitlement programs and our anti-competitive tax code.

Appearing in a "CBS This Morning" special report, Sen. Corker said the 80 percent error rate in Medicare's power wheelchair benefit "makes [his] blood boil" and is "taking total advantage of taxpayers" and seniors who have a legitimate medical need for a chair.  In September, Corker held a hearing of the Special Committee on Aging to examine a pilot program in seven states that will require prior authorization before chairs are delivered in order to reduce the rate of faulty claims.

"The United States continues to face significant national security challenges and it is critical to have strong leadership at the Pentagon that can respond to our evolving and emerging threats.  The nomination of Senator Hagel presents an opportunity to discuss not only his qualifications for the position and his approach to defending the United States and her allies, but also the specific ways in which he would seek to strengthen, modernize, and reform our national defense. I look forward to hearing Senator Hagelâ€™s answers to questions involving these important issues."

Two of my senate colleagues celebrate birthdays today: Sens. Rand Paul and John Thune. Happy birthday guys. It's a pleasure to serve with you.
Sen. Hagel's nomination for Defense Secretary is very concerning to me. His opposition to sanctions against Iran suggests he does not fully understand the risks facing us in the Middle East.
