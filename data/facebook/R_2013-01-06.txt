"Maine Republican values independent judgment, reaching across the aisle"    Read a nice profile of Senator Collins in the Portsmouth Herald.
I will not support Chuck Hagel’s nomination to the Department of Defense.  His record and past statements, particularly with respect to rogue nations like Iran, are extremely concerning to me.     His opposition to Iranian sanctions and support for direct, unconditional talks with its leaders is both at odds with current U.S. policy and a threat to global security. To make matters worse, he has called for direct negotiations with Hamas.   As Iran becomes increasingly hostile and gains influence in the region, the worst possible message we could send to our friend Israel and the rest of our allies in the Middle East is Chuck Hagel.
