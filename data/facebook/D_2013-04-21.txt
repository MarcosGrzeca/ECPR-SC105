Today, as part of the third Big Sky Honor Flight, we welcome more Montana veterans to Washington, D.C. to see the WWII Memorial built in their honor.  We will always be grateful for their service and never forget their sacrifice.
Like so many Rhode Islanders, I have watched with pride this week as our neighbors in Boston have shown the world what Americans are made of: resilient in the face of tragedy, compassionate in their assistance of others, and absolutely determined to band together as a community to help our law-enforcement officials.   I hope you will join me in thanking our law-enforcement officials. They worked swiftly and carefully to bring those responsible for the Boston Marathon tragedy to justice, losing one of their own, Officer Sean Collier, along the way.   I know this has been a truly difficult week, but Boston has reminded us all what we are made ofâ€¦this week, all Americans are Boston Strong.   Please join me in keeping all those who were injured, including officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. and all those we lost this week, in our hearts, minds and prayers.
Just lit the "diya" to celebrate the opening of the 7th annual Taste of India festival in Norfolk!
