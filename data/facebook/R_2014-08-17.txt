Senator Collins at this morning's Freedom Salute ceremony for the 133rd Engineer Battalion and 1035th Survey and Design team in Lewiston.
As a former judge and Attorney General I know the extraordinary power a prosecutor wields when he or she accuses a citizen of a crime. The circumstances of this indictment cry out "abuse" of that prosecutorial power. To attempt to criminalize the exercise of the very authority our constitution confers on a Governor should be condemned, not condoned.   Governor Perry has served our state for 14 years as governor, committed day in and day out to making a better life for all Texans. He has my full support.

America needs an all-of-the-above, innovative energy future to boost our energy security and create jobs. Glad to bring the Secretary of Energy up to Chena Hot Springs to listen to one of Alaska's top innovators: Bernie Karl.
