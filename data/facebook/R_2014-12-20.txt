Yesterday, President Obama signed the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act into law. It allows the creation of tax-exempt ABLE Accounts to assist individuals with disabilities to save and pay for qualified disability expenses. I had been a sponsor of this legislation since 2012, and it will enable individuals with disabilities or the parents of a child with a disability to save money to cover expenses such as education, housing, transportation, employment training and assistive technology. This new law will encourage personal responsibility and eliminate barriers to work that can exist within federal entitlement programs. Thanks again to Jawanda and Rachel Mast of Olathe for sharing their story and advocating for this legislation over the past few years. Click the link below to learn more about Rachel's story.
