Proud to be in Grand Forks to celebrate its selection as one of six unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) test sites. The community and state have worked hard and earned this opportunity.
The selection of Grand Forks as a UAS test site reinforces that Grand Forks area is an ideal location for military installations, and unmanned aerial systems in particular. This designation is the result of collaboration between community leaders, the University of North Dakota, and local, state, and federal officials. After meeting with numerous top military and Administration officials, and advocating for this selection, I’m thrilled Grand Forks has been picked. The test site will help grow the UAS industry throughout the nation and help make sure it can become a key part of North Dakota’s economy. Grand Forks is very deserving of this program, and I look forward to continuing to support the community and program throughout its implementation.
Congratulations to Virginia Tech and partners for being chosen by FAA to test unmanned aerial systems. I hope this FAA research and testing also helps sort-out the legitimate public concerns about privacy and air safety as we move toward a safe and responsible integration of unmanned aircraft.
Today, I requested a hearing to to examine whether companies and financial service providers are taking all actions necessary to safeguard consumer data and protect against fraud and identity theft, and whether stronger industry-wide cybersecurity standards are needed. More info below.
