Wishing a very happy birthday to the 46th Governor of Texas, the 43rd President of the United States, and a great American patriot, George W. Bush!
Those of who want to lead must remember "Democracy means constantly outperforming yourself or you are out on your backside "
Tomorrow on CBS Sunday Morning, at 8am CT, I talk about my #stroke recovery and why the key was to never, ever give up.
I recently heard good news about Project ARCH's expansion in Great Bend. Project ARCH is a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs program that enables rural veterans to receive care from local health care providers. The distances veterans — especially those living in rural America — are forced to travel for health care is a significant burden. With nearly 250,000 veterans living in Kansas, improving their access to quality health services closer to their homes is a top priority, and I will continue to look for ways to improve the services our veterans need and deserve.
