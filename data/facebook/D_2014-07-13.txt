View from Amtrak's Southwest Chief on the way to Las Vegas, N.M.
Spoke at the rededication ceremony for the 25th anniversary of the Custer House at Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park today about how the site is an important historical landmark, especially for North Dakotaâ€™s military history, but also has breathtaking views of the Dakota landscape.
Today I participated in Turtle Mountain Days, a week-long celebration of life on Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. In addition to the parade and picnic, I also spoke at the dedication ceremony for a new Native Americans memorial. Native Americans from Turtle Mountain have a rich history of serving our country in the military, and it is our duty to reciprocate that service when they return home. I will continue to fight for Native American veterans - just as they did for us - to help connect them with resources and benefits they earned. 
In just the last month, at least six caretakers in Connecticut have been charged with leaving children unattended in a vehicle, which is a misdemeanor under Connecticut law. I'm calling on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to bring federal resources to Connecticut to help to reduce the number of these heat-related injuries and deaths. These incidents are truly heartbreaking and must be prevented. http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Senators-Promote-Look-Before-You-Lock-Campaign-266814181.html
Had a great time at the Puerto Rican Day parade luncheon in Bridgeport yesterday!
