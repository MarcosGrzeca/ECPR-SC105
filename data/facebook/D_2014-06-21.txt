It is clear that allowing the #WorldCup and the infrastructure projects leading up to it to take place in Qatar is no longer acceptable in the face of widespread allegations of bribery and labor rights abuses.
Deeply saddened to hear of the death of U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Brandon Garabrant. Brandon was a hero in every sense of the word. He valiantly served our country and epitomized the bravery and sacrifice of every member of our armed forces, for which we will be forever grateful. I join the entire state of New Hampshire in extending my thoughts and prayers to his family and his loved ones. -JS
