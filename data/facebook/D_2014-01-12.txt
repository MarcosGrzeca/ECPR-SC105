Today, hundreds of veterans attended a Career Fair and Workshop hosted by my Southern Nevada office along with UNLV.

Congratulations to Virginia's own Orbital Sciences Corporation and NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on a successful delivery of supplies to the International Space Station! And a very Merry (and belated) Christmas to the six astronauts who are finally getting presents from their families.
