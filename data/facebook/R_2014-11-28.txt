Today marks the 89th anniversary of the founding of the Grand Ole Opry, the longest continuously running weekly radio broadcast with more than 4,500  consecutive Saturday evening shows and counting.   As Senator Alexander says, “There’s nothing quite like the Grand Ole Opry. If you understand how important the Alamo is to Texans, you’ll understand how important the Grand Ole Opry is to Tennesseans. And not just Tennesseans, but to many, many Americans. In the spirit of Minnie Pearl and the thousands of Americans who have created and enjoyed the Grand Ole Opry, Happy 89th Birthday, Grand Ole Opry.”

Today, I also held a listening tour stop in Cloud County at the Senior Center in Clyde. About 17 Kansans attended and we had a good discussion about the future of Medicare and concerns about over-regulation of community banks. Eric and Darlene Taylor, pictured below, spoke to me about future farm bills and over-reach at the EPA. Thanks again to Sherri Douglas for opening up the Senior Center to residents for my visit.
In north central Kansas today. Stopped for a few conversations in the community of Clifton. Was updated of what's going on in the community at City Hall, the post office and Kaw Valley State Bank.
Like me, I'm sure you've been inundated with commercials and ads for the 'Black Friday’ madness, but let's not forget Small Business Saturday. Buying locally means supporting your friends, neighbors, and community members who own and operate those businesses, supporting local hire, and strengthening the local economy.
