On this #MemorialDay, we recognize our veterans who have sacrificed in the service of this great country.   After a long winter, Americans are finally enjoying the outdoors and spending precious time with their loved ones.  We must always remember that we enjoy these freedoms because the members of the United States Military remain diligent, ready and willing to serve.  This year, 24-year-old Petty Officer Second Class Mark Mayo of Hagerstown, Maryland gave his life, as a civilian assaulted a fellow sailor and grabbed her gun, Petty Officer Mayo stepped into harmâ€™s way, shielded his shipmate, and died so that she could live. 
Had to bring the Maryland Terrapins to Kyiv.
As you prepare to celebrate Memorial Day tomorrow, I want to remind everyone to think of the men and women that we are honoring who have paid the ultimate price to protect our nation, as well as the veterans still with us today.
Congrats to Indy 500 winner Ryan Hunter-Reay.
Toured the Signal Fire yesterday in the Gila National Forest. Grateful for the men and women of the U.S. Forest Service and all the wildland firefighters who work hard everyday to keep the community safe.
I attended the 6th annual Fiesta Filipino in Las Vegas today. We all had a wonderful time, enjoyed some great food, and watched some beautiful performances. The Filipino culture adds so much diversity and strength to the fabric of American society.
Congrats to the @Marist Class of 2014!  #GoRedFoxes
What a treat at Republic Airport today- The Blue Angels!
