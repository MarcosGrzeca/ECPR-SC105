"My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Ariel Sharon and the people of Israel at this very difficult time. For eight years, they have stood vigil as a great general fought the greatest battle of his life. His legacy shall always be an unwavering dedication to the security of the Jewish State of #Israel and his willingness to move the peace process forward. May he now find the #shalom he always sought for the land of our ancestors."
In case you missed it, Senator Donnelly gave a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate on Wednesday outlining his Opportunity Agenda, a blueprint of common sense policies designed to expand economic opportunities for Hoosier workers, businesses, and their families in four critical areas.

Today in Fargo, I met with Senator Klobuchar, experts and advocates to discuss sex and human trafficking. While we already knew human and sex trafficking was a serious and growing concern, it was very helpful to hear from folks who are dealing with this issue right here in our communities. As a former Attorney General, I know how important it is to assist victims of these horrific crimes, and do all we can to prevent them from happening in the first place. Working with Senator Klobuchar and a bipartisan coalition of other Senators on our bill to crack down on human and sex trafficking, Iâ€™m committed to raising awareness, and putting in place concrete steps to put an end to it. http://www.heitkamp.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=c3cb7d5c-de06-4496-839d-f010e1d1c878
