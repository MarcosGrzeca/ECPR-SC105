Happy Dover Days!
Very glad I had the opportunity to see the "Best Kept Secret" at the Montclair Film Festival today. The documentary is about autistic students at Newark’s JFK High School and it inspires me to continue to fight for those with autism. Congrats to all involved with the great film!
Countdown to WV’s 150th Birthday: Day 47 – Randolph County  Fact: The first 4-H camp in the world was held here.  Recommendation: Stop by West Virginia’s oldest festival, the Mountain State Forest Festival http://www.forestfestival.com/
Tomorrow, I'm hosting my 6th annual breakfast for Veterans, servicemembers and their families. And this year, I’m turning it into a resource fair as well.  I hope you’ll join us.  Servicemembers and their families will have the chance to speak with representatives from various federal agencies and programs that provide resources to Rhode Island’s Veteran community.  In addition, my staff will be available to help assist you with any issues you may be having with a federal agency. For details and to RSVP, please use the link below.
