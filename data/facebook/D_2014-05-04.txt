Great to meet the men and women of the 238th MEDEVAC unit. Thank you for your service.
You must not let fear of the unknown or unfamiliar stop you from your next challenge. The fact is, if I let fear set in, I wouldn’t have left the farm. I wouldn’t have graduated from college. I wouldn’t have run for the school board or become a state senator. And I sure wouldn’t have become a U.S. Senator.
We'll never be able to fully repay the debt we owe our veterans, but we can do everything we can to observe their sacrifice and keep the promises we've made to them.  So today, I hosted my 7th Annual Veterans Breakfast and Resource Fair — to hear from veterans and their families about the issues that affect them most and connect them to key resources.  For all those who joined me today: thank you for coming, and thank you for your service.
