Today, Joe made the following statement after learning about the murder of Abdul-Rahman (Peter) Kassig, an Indianapolis native.   “My family and I are heartbroken for Paula and Ed Kassig. As a parent, I can think of no greater tragedy than losing a child.  Abdul-Rahman (Peter) dedicated himself to providing medical assistance to Syrian refugees, and he will be remembered as someone who made extraordinary sacrifices to assist others in need.  We are incredibly proud of Abdul-Rahman’s humanitarian work.  I ask all Hoosiers to join me and my family as we continue to pray for the Kassig family and keep them in our thoughts as they mourn the loss of their son.”
Looking forward to my Facebook Q&A tomorrow, Monday, November 17 at 6:00pm CT to answer your questions about my efforts to address North Dakota’s new safety challenges. The energy development in our state has greatly helped produce jobs and economic growth, but it has also brought new challenges – such as an increase in crime, human trafficking and infrastructure stress – that we must face head on. Learn more about my Strong & Safe Communities Initiative and my efforts to address these challenges here: http://1.usa.gov/1pR3aXf. And join my tomorrow at 6pm CT to ask me your questions.
