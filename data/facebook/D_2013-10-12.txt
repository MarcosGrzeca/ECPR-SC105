Congratulations to my friend Nancy Pelosi on her worthy induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame! It's such a fine and deserved honor for a wonderful leader.
Our position is that we should re-open the government, pay our bills, and then move forward with good-faith negotiations on a long-term budget. I thank the President for inviting Republicans and Democrats to the White House this week to talk with him. Unfortunately, House Republicans refused his offer and sent only 20 of its 232 members.  The problem right now is that the conversation is one-way; Republicans are not interested in doing anything constructive to raise the debt ceiling and open the government. Itâ€™s not too late for our Republican colleagues to do the right thing for this country.
