I’m so excited that Little League baseball begins across Delaware this weekend. Here’s to a safe, fun season for all young Delawareans!
I want to thank all of the volunteers who came out to my first Citizen Day service project today in Richmond. Their willingness to help others in need is truly inspiring. I'm looking forward to the next Citizen Day!
