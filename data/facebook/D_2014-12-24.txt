Gayle and I would like to wish all West Virginians a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We pray that each of you enjoy a holiday season filled with perpetual hope and peace, especially our brave servicemen and women who are serving overseas. May God bless you all with joy and love during this special season and throughout the New Year. Happy holidays!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frf-GhctS20&list=UUGyPK_ye2ptpzQgOjKIn7ag
I am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Sarann Knight Preddy. Sarann has been an integral part of Nevada since she moved to Las Vegas during WWII. She dedicated her life to the Southern Nevada community, operating businesses and supporting charitable and social endeavors. Sarann was a true friend and I appreciated her advice and counsel and enjoyed our friendship. She will truly be missed.
Was so touched that our former Army fellow, Lt. Col Sam Glover, took time to visit Washington last week. Sam finished another tour in Afghanistan just in time to be home for the holidays with his beautiful family. Thank you Sam for your service and your friendship. Thoughts and prayers this time of year for the many members of our Armed Forces serving at home and abroad who will not be home for the holidays. We thank you.
