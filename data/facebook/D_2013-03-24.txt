A great photo of my wife, Julie, and me with President Obama last month. I was showing him photos of the Río Grande del Norte. Tomorrow, I will join the President for the signing ceremony in the Oval Office to establish the Río Grande del Norte as a U.S. National Monument. This will truly be an historic moment.    For more than a century, the Antiquities Act has given American presidents the authority to protect our nation’s most treasured landscapes, and the Río Grande del Norte is indeed a treasure. My deepest thanks go out to Senator Jeff Bingaman and the local community for championing this effort, and to President Obama for recognizing just how special the Río Grande del Norte is.
