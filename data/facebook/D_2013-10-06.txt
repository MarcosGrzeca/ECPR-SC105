I am pleased that the Department of Defense has announced that our service members, National Guard and civilians who serve and protect our country every day will receive the pay they have earned and deserve during this senseless government shutdown, and that they will continue their mission.   I also thank Secretary Hagel for recalling most of the Department of Defense back to work to make sure that our country remains strong while the gridlock in Washington continues.   In the coming days, I will review the details of this announcement with leaders of the National Guard, the Department of Defense, the Administration and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our national security is not disrupted.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pentagon-to-recall-most-furloughed-workers-hagel-says/2013/10/05/eb7ed346-2deb-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html
Uninsured Nevadans are so desperate for Obamacare that they are calling the enrollment hotline in tears. This law is necessary, it's working, and I will keep fighting for it.
