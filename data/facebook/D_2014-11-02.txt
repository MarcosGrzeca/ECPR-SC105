Yesterday, Tammy was in Northeast WI to Get Out The Vote and thank volunteers in Fond du Lac, Sheboygan, Manitowoc and Oshkosh.   "Volunteers are the greatest asset our Democratic candidates have in the last days of this campaign. You are the ones who will close the deal!" - TB

Thanks to Kent-Sussex Industries, Inc. (KSI) for doing wonderful work in the community. I had a great visit to KSI's Milford office last week.
It was a great honor to attend the grand opening of the newly expanded and renovated North Dakota Heritage Center & State Museum on our state's 125th anniversary of statehood today. The Heritage Center & State Museum will create a lasting impact for our state, as it helps preserve North Dakota's culture, history, and relics for generations to come.
All across North Dakota, folks have always found a way to come together. From the vast prairies to the badlands of the west to the growing cities – every day we continue to strengthen our collective pride in this land we call home. We see this pride in the rich heritage of our Native brothers and sisters, we see it in our farmers who work from sun-up to sun-down to help feed our state and the world, and we see it in every day events like planning weddings and family reunions around harvest and season openers. Throughout the past 125 years, North Dakota and its people have come a long way – through tough times, unprecedented economic prosperity, and everything in between. But I know that with our continued dedication and unparalleled hard work, we can keep creating incredible success and opportunity – together – for 125 more years. http://1.usa.gov/13vp2x7
