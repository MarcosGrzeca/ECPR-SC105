We will never forget #PearlHarbor.  Remembering the brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice 73 years ago today.
Today on #PearlHarbor Remembrance Day and every day, we honor those who made the tremendous sacrifice to keep our country safe.
Today we remember the sacrifice and courage displayed on the ships, airfields, and docks of Pearl Harbor 73 years ago. Let us honor all of those who lost their lives on that fateful day, the patriots and heroes of that era in our history, and the veterans of all our nation's wars and conflicts. This great nation remains free today because of the example set by Americans from that Greatest Generation and those from successive generations who have served in harmâ€™s way. On this Pearl Harbor Day, let the significance of that attack on our soil serve as a reminder that our democracy and way of life are precious gifts that must be continually protected and preserved.
Today marks the 73rd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. We honor and remember all of those who lost their lives on that day.

Pearl Harbor Day!  Thank a veteran.

May we never forget the men and women who lost their lives in an unspeakable act of aggression 73 years ago. On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor launching the United States into World War II.  The Greatest Generation heroically answered the call to defend freedom and defeat evil across the world. May we continue to honor their sacrifice by doing all we can to preserve the beacon of freedom in our own time.
On the 73rd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Diana and I reflect on the tragedy which shook the world. We must never forget the 2,400 people who lost their lives on this infamous day. We salute the veterans and survivors of Pearl Harbor and those who defended our freedom during World War II. Against overwhelming odds, they fought back courageously, and helped make our nation what it is today.
