The Small Business Summit on March 19 will be a great opportunity for North Dakota’s small businesses to learn about major trends and forces influencing small business in our region, as well as hear from a senior Google executive about how small businesses can use online resources. Small businesses represent 96% of all employers in North Dakota, and I’m proud to co-host this event that will help such a large number of North Dakotans. Register below to take part.
