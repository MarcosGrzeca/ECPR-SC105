On Syria, in order to convince Congress POTUS first needs to convince the American people
Enjoyed speaking to Texas Society of Anesthesiologists yesterday about common sense health care reforms after Obamacare fails.
Thx to Olympic Comm for retaining Wrestling in future contests   Whether it was bc of my Senate Resolution or whatever "thanks"
I enjoyed spending the weekend visiting with Kansans at the 100th Annual Kansas State Fair. The conversations were again dominated by concerns with U.S. involvement in Syria, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the Farm Bill. Tomorrow I will be back in Washington and will keep in mind the thoughts and feedback Kansans shared with me â€” thanks for the good dose of Kansas common sense.
Preparing to appear on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace. I will continue to explain why the U.S. should not intervene in Syria. Be sure to tune in!
Franki and I are proud to be supporting the cancer prevention and screening booth at the @KansasStateFair again this year. Be sure to stop by if you are at the fair!
