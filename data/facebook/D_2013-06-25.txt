The Supreme Court’s decision to invalidate this key part of the Voting Rights Act – legislation that 98 Senators and 390 Representatives voted to extend in 2006 – is an example of judicial overreach at its worst. This decision rolls back hard-fought civil rights protections, undoes nearly 50 years of accepted law, and imperils progress even as Americans in certain counties and states face new barriers to voting. The good news is that, although the formula to determine which jurisdictions fall under the pre-clearance provision in the Voting Rights Act has been struck down, the provision itself is still intact. Consequently, I will immediately begin working with my colleagues in the Senate on a bill to establish a new formula that ensures all Americans are given an equal right to vote.
  
 Let this decision not be a setback; let it be a call to arms. On behalf of the generations who fought valiantly to rid our country of oppressive and racist poll taxes, we must rededicate ourselves today to the intent of the Voting Rights Act and ensure that collectively we remain committed to its goals.

***Floor Statement 6-25-2013***  We must take advantage of this rare opportunity to make robust changes in our broken immigration system.
***Breaking*** CARDIN RESPONDS TO SUPREME COURT DECISION HARMING VOTING RIGHTS  “American Voters Will Pay a Price for the Supreme Court’s Judicial Activism”  Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) responded to the Supreme Court decision today in Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, invalidating the coverage formula that determines which jurisdictions are subject to the preclearance provisions of the Act. The Court majority has passed the issue back to Congress.   “Congress must act quickly to reverse today’s erroneous decision by the Supreme Court which overturned several important precedents in a fit of judicial activism. As much as we wish it wasn’t so, racism has not disappeared from America and there continue to be individuals and groups who would use our voting system to deliberately minimize the rights of minority voters. Congress overwhelmingly reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006 after building an extensive record that made a compelling case for the continued need to protect minority voters from discrimination.  I strongly agree with Justice Ginsburg’s dissent that ‘in truth, the evolution of voting discrimination into more subtle second-generation barriers is powerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclearance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and prevent backsliding.’”  I am deeply disappointed that the Court put voting rights in jeopardy by ignoring reality and disregarding the power of Congress to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution by ‘appropriate legislation.”  Senator Cardin has previously introduced legislation, the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act, which would institute tough new criminal and civil penalties for individuals who create and distribute false and deceptive literature designed to suppress minority voters.
Throughout my time as Governor, and now Senator, I have had the opportunity to meet many different small business owners in Delaware who just so happen to have been born in a different country. These hardworking individuals contribute each and every day to our economy and our community, but our immigration system can make it difficult for them to continue to live and work in the United States. This great website outlines how immigrants contribute to Delaware and America’s economy. As we debate immigration reform, I think it is important to remember that immigrants provide a lot to our nation. http://www.maptheimpact.org/state/delaware/
Seventy-five years ago, as the U.S. was still to emerge from the Great Depression, a major worker rights law was enacted.  The Fair Labor Standards Act incorporated a number of important provisions including the establishment of a minimum wage.

The Court has taken the legs out from underneath the Voting Rights Act, making it impossible for the Department of Justice to enforce the critical civil rights protections afforded under Section 5.
For almost 50 years, the Voting Rights Act has protected minority populations from discrimination at the ballot box, whether in the form of poll taxes, literacy tests or voter identification laws and discriminatory redistricting. We need look no further than the last election cycle to understand the ongoing importance of the Voting Rights Act. Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is a major setback for the voting rights that courageous Americans have fought for generations to protect. Now, Congress has a responsibility to respond promptly by taking legislative action addressing voting discrimination and inequality. As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, I will be holding hearings to address this troubling decision by the Supreme Court.
From supporting the first resolution in the Senate designating PTSD Awareness Month to introducing the Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act, Joe continues to advocate for mental health programs in our country’s Armed Services. In honor of PTSD Awareness Month, take part in the Department of Veterans Affairs’ “Take a Step” campaign, and let’s continue to help our nation’s heroes battling with PTSD or other related mental health issues.

I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court's decision to limit the Voting Rights Act. By invalidating a key piece of the law, the Supreme Court departed from settled precedent and dealt a real setback for voting rights in this country.
Today, I attended President Obama’s speech on climate change at Georgetown University. It's morally imperative that we embrace the challenge of reversing the effects of climate change and lead the world in innovation and clean energy, using science as our guide to making solid policy decisions.
The bill I wrote will incentivize refinancing, allowing students to benefit from incredibly low interest rates. I have heard from countless students who are trapped because of an overwhelming amount of private student loan debt. This does not only impact them, it is a drain on our entire economy.

I ran for the U.S. Senate because I wanted to help find solutions to major problems facing our country. For far too long, Washington has kicked the can down the road when it comes to our housing financing system. I am committed to moving forward a bipartisan plan that protects taxpayers, provides certainty to the industry, and ensures that the 30-year-fixed-rate mortgage is available for North Dakotans in the future.
Passing comprehensive immigration reform will reduce our deficit by an estimated $890 billion through 2033. In Virginia alone, it will create an estimated 20,280 jobs and boost our economy by $5.2 billion. We must pass this critical legislation that will help millions of families and grow our economy.
Today, the President laid out a series of steps to address the negative effects of carbon pollution on our environment.   I applaud the focus and am studying the details of the proposal with care.   I believe the scientific consensus that we must reduce our reliance on carbon-based energy.   America has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 9 percent since 2005 through innovation in energy use and production, dramatic improvements in energy efficiency and smart policy choices.  We need to continue to make energy cleaner tomorrow than today as a strategy to tackle climate issues.  For this reason, I have recently advocated that we avoid use of tar sands oil.   At the same time, there is no realistic plan that involves eliminating fossil fuel in the short or mid-term.   We must reduce our carbon usage wisely through regulations that properly phase in new requirements over time and don’t unduly impact communities that rely on coal production. And, as we do so, we can scale up our investments in low and no carbon energy sources in ways that will increase American jobs.  As in so many areas, this is fundamentally about finding a balanced approach that capitalizes on American innovation.  I look forward to tackling that challenge with businesses, researchers, my Senate colleagues and, especially, Virginians who believe that economic growth and environmental stewardship can go hand in hand.
The Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the validity of the Voting Rights Act preclearance requirement but specify that Congress must grapple anew with the appropriate geographic application of the technique raises serious concerns, particularly with regard to how voting rights will be protected in the interim in places where discrimination still exists.  As a former member of state and local elected bodies subject to preclearance rules, I have generally found the process straightforward and, given the importance of voting, not onerous. I look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues to determine how we can continue to rigorously protect the voting rights of all. In the meantime, I would advocate that jurisdictions continue to submit voting changes to the Department of Justice for preclearance as a sign to their own constituents that they are committed to ensuring equal voting rights.
It was great to see my friends Sen. Mark Warner, Gov. Bob McDonnell & former Sen. John Warner at Mount Vernon last night to celebrate the legacy of our 1st president.
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who is managing consideration of the comprehensive immigration reform bill before the Senate, delivered a statement Tuesday on the Senate Floor about his family’s immigration experience.   “Nearly every American family has a story like mine and Marcelle’s,” said Leahy. “ We are more alike than we are different from today’s immigrants and first-generation Americans.  The majority of new immigrants will continue this proud tradition of hard work, the drive toward prosperity, and embracing the values that make America great.  They will someday tell their children and grandchildren of their own immigrant histories.  The bill we consider will continue this cycle of growth and renewal and will improve on many aspects of our immigration system.”

It’s clear now that the President has declared a war on coal since the key element of his climate change proposal places regulations on coal that are completely impossible to meet with existing technology.  This country is going to need coal long into our future. Removing coal from our energy mix will have disastrous consequences for our recovering economy. I am committed to fighting these destructive policies.   Read more:  http://1.usa.gov/10S3w2X
I agree with President Obama: We need to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution into our air. In recent years, Americans have endured devastating droughts, wildfires and floods, while our coastal communities have been battered by destructive storms. These extreme weather events hurt our economy and exact a terrible human toll.
 
 President Obama’s plan will create jobs by encouraging investment in clean energy and energy efficiency, and strengthening our nation’s resilience to extreme weather and climate impacts. I have personally seen how smart energy policies are creating jobs in Nevada.
Today’s Supreme Court decision striking down a key part of the Voting Rights Act is a deeply disappointing example of extreme judicial activism. We need look no further than the recent election to see the unfortunate reality that bigotry still exists in our country. We should be doing everything possible to encourage participation in the democratic process and ensure every eligible voter is able to exercise his or her right to cast a ballot. Congress needs to right the wrong of this decision and ensure that we do not turn back the clock on America’s democratic progress. The Senate will act.
I’m disappointed the Supreme Court struck down one of the most important achievements of the Civil Rights movement in its ruling today. 
 
 Our right to vote is one of our most important freedoms and the Voting Rights Act has protected that right for millions of Americans since President Johnson signed it into law back in 1965. While we have made progress since then, the fact is that voter suppression and discrimination sadly still exists in our country, and that fact underscores the need to keep voting rights protections in place.  
 
 It’s now up to Congress to act on our responsibility to protect voting rights of all Americans and I hope that we do so quickly as possible.

There's no doubt that climate change is real, and the costs aren't just monetary - it's a direct challenge to our way of life in the southwest. From less snowpack in the mountains to forests burning out of control and 10+ years of drought, the challenges are serious. It's time to restart the conversation and I invite my Republican colleagues to work with us. Watch my speech from the Senate floor and share if you agree - it's time for us to act on climate change.

Housing finance is the last piece of unfinished business remaining after the 2008 economic meltdown. We have designed thoughtful reforms that will protect taxpayers from future downturns while responsibly preserving the availability of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for home buyers.
It is critical that we have an electoral system that is open, fair and not overly burdensome. This is particularly important given our history of unfairly restricting access to the ballot in Virginia. I am deeply disappointed in today’s Supreme Court ruling, and  I will work with my colleagues in Congress and move quickly to put in place a fair process that ensures our elections are open to all. #VRA #VotingRightsAct
We need real #housing finance reform. Proud to introduce bipartisan legislation today with Senator Bob Corker to protect taxpayers from future bailouts caused by economic downturns and preserve market liquidity.
Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) and I are headed to Squawk Box on CNBC at 8:15am to announce our bipartisan bill to strengthen the #housing finance system.
The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important civil rights statutes ever enacted by this country. It was designed to protect voters from discrimination and has been an incredible success for over 40 years. In 2006 it was reauthorized by overwhelming bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress. Incredibly, the Supreme Court today voted to gut some of the Voting Rights Act’s most important provisions. I strongly disagree with this decision and call on Congress to act swiftly and reverse it.
