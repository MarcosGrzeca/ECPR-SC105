Will Rouhani take the "moderate" step of recanting statement about Israel being a "wound" on the Arab world?
Will new Iranian President Rouhani take the "moderate" step of liberating 2600+ political & religious prisoners like:   Mohammad Seifzadeh Abdolfattah Soltani Mohammad Ali Dadkhah Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh Mehdi Karoubi Mir Hossein Mousavi Zahra Rahnavard Pastor Saeed Abedini Mostafa Bordbar Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi
Today I visited Onaga for the Pottawatomie County Fair Parade and a visit with the Board of Trustees and leadership of the Community Healthcare System with hospitals in Onaga and St. Maryâ€™s. During my travels I saw beautiful churches in Blaine, Wheaton, Duluth, Onaga and Louisville. Fitting scenes from a Sunday drive in Kansas.
Good Sunday morning!
This morning at 11:10 a.m. CT I'll visit with Shannon Bream on Fox News Channel about my concerns with the IRS implementing Obamacare as well as the importance of creating jobs for Americans by passing a series of smaller, targeted immigration reform bills. Unfortunately, the Senate's all-or-nothing approach to legislating resulted in one massive and flawed bill. Please tune in!
I'm glad I had the opportunity to visit with First Sergeant Chad Dikeman and Captain Jason Knudson of the 469 Ground Ambulance tonight at the All American Beef Battalion steak feed and thank them for their service.
Verne and I were able to attend the blessing of the new Covenant House in Anchorage -- a beautiful building that will be housing some great kids.  So glad we could be there to witness the blessing of this new addition to the downtown community.
My best birthday wishes today for the President of the United States, BarackObama.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.
