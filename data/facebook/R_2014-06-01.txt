Secretary Clinton is more focused on blaming the so-called vast right-wing conspiracy than terrorists. The truth shouldn't be partisan.   There's a pattern in this Administration: the pattern is, when a crisis, a scandal emerges, to express outrage... after expressing outrage, they stonewall for months or years, and then they say it's old news. We need to get to the truth on #Benghazi!  See more from my sit-down with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week:
This morning at 7:45 a.m. CT I'll visit with Fox and Friends on Fox News Channel about VA Secretary Shinseki's resignation and the path forward toward a Department of Veterans Affairs that is worthy of our veterans' service and sacrifice. We do not need more damage control – we need to eliminate the damage being done to our nation’s veterans. I hope you'll tune in.
