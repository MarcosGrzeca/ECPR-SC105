Celebrating the many mothers in my life today. So proud this great American tradition started in West Virginia. Happy Mother's Day!
My mother had a tremendous influence on me. She taught me the importance of hard work, commitment, and dedication to working on behalf of others. Today, on Mother’s Day, all sons and daughters take time to reflect on the care and love that their mothers showed them through the years. Mothers of all backgrounds work hard to support their children and families. They devote themselves to nurturing their children and they instill in them strong character and morals. We are all so grateful for their support today, and all days.
