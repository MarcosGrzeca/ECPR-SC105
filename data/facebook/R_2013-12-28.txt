The United States Capitol Dome is beginning a major restoration project and now you can view the project through an animated video. This animation shows a rendering of what the Dome will look like during the project as the scaffolding is installed and removed.

This morning on a Kansas Listening Tour Stop in Grandview Plaza, Kansas, folks stopped by to discuss the budget agreement, veteran and military issues, my plan for health care, education, the local water district, highway funding, and the need for Republicans and Democrats to work together. Thanks for the good dose of Kansas Common Sense and for the great breakfast served by Stacy's Restaurant.
Went cross country skiing in Girdwood yesterday.  It was about 10 degrees and lovely snow blanketed the meadows.  We are truly blessed to live in such a beautiful state!
Happy 225th Birthday to the Queen City #Cincinnati
