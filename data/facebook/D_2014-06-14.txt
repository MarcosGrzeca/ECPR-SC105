We should use #FlagDay to remember what our flag stands for. Flag Day is about honoring our nation’s history paying special tribute to all that our flag represents, including the principles of justice, equality and liberty.  Flag Day gives us an opportunity to reflect on these core beliefs and to celebrate the ideals that the symbol of our nation represents to all Americans and to people around the world.      We must remember that the ideals for which we stand are defended by brave Americans in uniform. In the days since the Second Continental Congress adopted a flag to represent “a new constellation”, millions of Americans have carried the flag into battle. Our banner still waves and our values endure because of their sacrifices.  By flying the flag, we thank them for their service and reaffirm our commitment to keep America strong and free.”
Today, I’m hosting a summit in Bismarck to connect Native American veterans with the resources, support, and benefits they have earned and deserve. The event is about bringing together our Native veterans, leaders in the community, and veterans officials, including U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and Interior Department Assistant Secretary – Indian Affairs Kevin Washburn – and engage in an open dialogue about the very real challenges that exist and what we can do to correct them. Only then can we say we have honored our commitment to Native veterans.
Wishing a Happy 239th Birthday to the U.S. Army. Thankful today and every day for all those who serve. #ArmyBday
Was 7 when the Dodgers left, but here at the @BrooklynCyclones game, baseball is alive & well in #Brooklyn!
Stopped to see opening day of the Thunderbolt while biking. Might have tried the 90 degree drop 50yrs ago but not now! Coney Island revitalized!
