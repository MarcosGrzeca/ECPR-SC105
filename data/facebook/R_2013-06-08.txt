I had the opportunity to address tomorrow's leaders at the graduation ceremony for Cornhusker Boys State this morning. Fine young men from across Nebraska. We expect great things from all of you.
It was an honor and privilege to address the 92nd VFW Convention Friday afternoon in Omaha and see so many good friends. Thank you again for your sacrifice and service.
Friday I attended the Lenexa Chamber of Commerce's Business Blast and Taste of Lenexa at the historic grounds of the Lackman Thompson Estate. I visited with business owners about issues affecting their companies including taxes, immigration and hiring new employees. Thanks to the Lenexa Chamber for supporting and promoting your business community.
Jane & I are soon to be empty-nesters. So proud of my daughter Sally on her high school graduation tonight!
