Finally meeting Brett & his family this weekend was an honor. Brett’s father-in-law contacted my office to help arrange for catastrophic disability coverage after Brett suffered a terrible swimming accident.   As his wife said, “It’s hard but we are strong. Brett’s motto is ‘One minute, one hour, one day.’ Today might be hard but tomorrow might be better. Brett volunteered for multiple tours of Iraq in the mid-2000s, when it was super-dangerous. So with this, he’s very strong.”   Read more about Brett, and leave him well-wishes in the comments: http://j.mp/1x0GX7p

I joined Senator Gillibrand and Senator Durbin to call on USDA to implement stronger safety standards against food pathogens.
Last month, a bipartisan bill I introduced was signed into law which will help level the playing field for Indian tribes in North Dakota and across the country. The Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act will stop tribes from being unfairly taxed for programs that support health care, education, and housing assistance for Native families, making sure tribes are recognized as sovereign nations. By working together, we can continue to push for critical legislation that stands up for Native communities and families, including bills like the Violence Against Women Act.
