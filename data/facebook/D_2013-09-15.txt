Today marks the beginning of National Hispanic Heritage Month. Let’s take this time to celebrate the heritage, culture and immense contributions of Latinos across Virginia and the United States. I’m proud to co-sponsor a resolution establishing that the Senate recognizes today as the start of Hispanic Heritage Month and acknowledges the integral role of Latinos in the economy, culture, and identity of our nation.
