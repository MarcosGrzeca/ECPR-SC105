IRS scandal: Day 80
For something completely different: Baylor grad, RGIII's knees, and their prospects this NFL season.
RIP: Kidd Kraddick, who entertained millions of Texans for 20+yrs & made life's mission to bring hope to terminally ill children & their families

RIP Col. Bud Day - my friend, my leader, my inspiration. A genuine American hero.
Kelley and I were joined yesterday by Congressman Andy Barr and Lee Greenwood (who brought the crowd to its feet when he sang "God Bless the USA") as Matt Bradford and his wife, Amanda, were presented with the key to their new home in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Two champions of this project were Helping A Hero.Org founder Meredith Iler and builder Randall Peterson. 
 
 Literally hundreds of well-wishers from the community turned out to welcome the Bradfords to their new custom-built home. Kelley and I are humbled to have played a small role in this project.
