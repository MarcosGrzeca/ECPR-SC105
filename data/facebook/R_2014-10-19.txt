This morning I joined Chuck Todd on NBC's Meet the Press to discuss the #Ebola outbreak, including my support for a temporary suspension of travel visas for passengers in Ebola-stricken countries and the Obama Administrationâ€™s handling of the response. Watch here if you missed this morning:
The Obama Administration unfortunately is not acting to protect our southern border or to restrict commercial airline flights from places with an active Ebola outbreak. And that just doesn't make sense.
