Today I was honored to help send off the North Dakota National Guard's 2-285th Battalion as they embark on their second deployment. Thank you to the soldiers and their families for their dedication to our country and their bravery. In North Dakota, we understand the importance of military service, and we're seeing that here today. I wish the soldiers a successful mission, and am looking forward to their safe return.
