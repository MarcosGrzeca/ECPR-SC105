Today’s Tribal Highlight, in honor of National American Indian Heritage Month, is the Seminole Tribe. Here are five fast facts about the Seminoles:    1. Wewoka, Oklahoma is the Seminole Nation Capitol chosen for settlement in 1849 due to its fertile land between the North and South Canadian Rivers. The word Wewoka comes from the Seminole term for “Barking Water”.   2. WWII American Seminole Code Talker Edmond Harjo was born in Maud, Oklahoma.   3. The largest group of the “Seminole Freedmen” lives in Seminole County, Oklahoma. This group continues the traditional culture of both African American culture and American Indian culture.   4. The tribal name “Seminole” comes from the Spanish term “cimarrones” used to describe the Floridian tribe. That name was translated by the Creek tribe as “semvlonÄ” which later turned into “Semvnole”.    5. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is a federally recognized tribal nation with a government anchored by a Band system, which is comprised of 12 traditional bands and two freedman bands.

After Clyde, I traveled north to Cuba to listen to about 32 residents share their questions and concerns about health care, the Department of Veterans Affairs, entrepreneurship and bureaucracy in Washington. The community suffered a great lost recently with the death of Dale Huncovsky, owner of the Cuba Cash Store. Hearing stories about Dale reminded me of what I loved about growing up in rural America – the strong sense of community. I appreciate folks taking away time from family over the Thanksgiving holiday to visit with me and share their thoughts.
