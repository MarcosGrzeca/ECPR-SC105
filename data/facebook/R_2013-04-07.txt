Statement: The unexpected passing of Chairman Gibson brings great sadness to the Tribes, the Owyhee area, to myself and to Idaho.  Terry was an outstanding leader and he was my friend.  He was always a trusted partner and strong leader with the courage and foresight to tackle the many issues facing the Tribes.  My prayers are with his wife, Debbie, his children, his family and all of the people of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.
