ICYMI: Michael Lollar’s article in The Commercial Appeal: “Memphis again travels to top 20 travel spot.” Citing a recent Microsoft News Web site ranking of the top 20 travel destinations in the world, Lollar writes, “its musical heritage and attention to food and the outdoors helped the city climb into the ranks of such perennial travel destinations as Paris.” Please “LIKE” or “SHARE” if, like Sen. Alexander, you’re a fan of Memphis – or if you call Memphis “home.” http://bit.ly/13DghJH

Obamacare Fact: Hurting the Economy and Jobs  41% of small business owners have delayed plans to hire new employees, and 38% say they have delayed plans to grow their businesses in direct response to the law.
The wheels are coming off Obamacare. The American people realize this isn't working: http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2013/08/ted-cruz-mobilizes-talk-radio-army-as-he-battles-obamacare/
A must-see video of beautiful scenes throughout Nebraska. Looking forward to visiting many of these areas as I travel across the state this month! #TheGoodLife
Had a great day in Omaha full of informative meetings w/ several groups! Enjoyed lunch in Millard and had a terrific exchange of ideas at a listening session in Elkhorn. Capped off the day with an evening drive on the Lincoln Highway - so good to be home in Nebraska! Looking forward to another productive day in the Omaha metro area tomorrow.

The Dakota Prairie Diesel Refinery is a prime example of the kind of infrastructure investments we need to build a strong energy future for North Dakota and our nation. This refinery will not only create jobs and the diesel we need in this region, but it will help to grow our domestic energy production. It’s a prime example of how we can leverage American energy resources to help make our nation more energy secure and independent.  http://www.hoeven.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=8873c316-492f-43ec-9d03-c1142f830f7f

Obamacare math: Company X has 40 full-time employees working 40 hours per week, along with 20 part-time employees working 15 hours per week. The 20 part-time employees are counted as 10 full-time equivalent employees. Company X has 50 full-time employees and is subject to the employer shared responsibility provisions.  Share this if you agree that we should create jobs and restore economic growth by defunding #Obamacare.

Sporting Kansas City's 2012 U.S. Open Cup victory qualified them as one of just two American soccer clubs to participate in the 2013 CONCACAF Champions League, a competition of the best teams in Central America, North America and the Caribbean. Tonight Sporting KC plays the first match of their Champions League campaign in Nicaragua against Real Esteli.
Though drought persists in western Kansas, other areas of our state face flooding. Be safe and lookout for floodwater on roads.
A local tradition! The woman who lives in that house always waves with a white towel as the ferry goes by.  Today, I thought I would wave back.
Another fabulous day on the water!  Captain Leighton and I are enjoying the beauty of Alaska on the deck of the ferry Taku and waved hello to our friends on the Matanuska on the Wrangell Narrows.  Sometimes I just have to take a step back and appreciate how am truly blessed we are to live in such an awesome state!
These last few days, I have been reminded that some of the best conversations are held around a fire in Southeast Alaska listening to Humpback whales singing. Now, it’s off to Wrangell on the M/V Taku.  As I travel around our state, I am also reminded that a lot of things can be solved by just talking and listening to each other- fire and humpback’s songs or not.  I think that’s a good lesson for my colleagues in DC.
Sitting down Joe Viechnicki at KFSK Radio in Petersburg this morning to talk energy issues, the DC partisan gridlock (including my efforts to break it) and my upcoming tour of the Tongass with U.S. Forest Service Chief Tidwell.
Meeting with the Petersburg Vessel Owners Association this morning.  Big thanks to the busy fishermen who came to discuss the issues affecting their industry and community.
I toured the Rocky Pass Seafood plant this afternoon.  With 24 employees, it’s the largest private employer in Kake and buys all species of salmon and halibut from the local fleet.  It’s a great example of building up an economy based on Alaska’s natural resources.
Made it to Kake this afternoon where more than 60 residents came to a community meeting to share their concerns with me.  As you might guess, the high cost of energy has been the #1 topic.
In case you missed it: The Wall Street Journal wrote a profile on my friend, Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie.    Read more here: http://massieforms.house.gov/news/email/show.aspx?ID=CZYWDSZOMYZ4J36NFFJ5BOKHCI
