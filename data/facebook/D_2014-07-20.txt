There are so many selfless North Dakotans who are dedicated to adoption and improving the lives of children. That is why each year, I look forward to honoring an individual, family or organization as Angels in Adoption to highlight the extraordinary things they’re doing for children in need. Nominate someone in your community to be the 2014 Angel in Adoption today by simply filling out a form below – the deadline is Wednesday, July 23. 
Our bill will help pet owners focus on their dogs' or cats' health rather than medication costs.
