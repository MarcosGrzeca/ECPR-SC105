Very pleased the Senate has passed H.R 699 A Bill To Improve The Health Of Children And Help Better Understand And Enhance Awareness About Unexpected Sudden Death In Early Life.    The bipartisan, no cost, legislation introduced in the Senate by Sherrod Brown amends the Public Health Service Act to help enhance awareness about unexpected sudden death in early life. The legislation provides for the continued development and updating of standard protocols and data collection related to stillbirths and sudden unexpected deaths in infants and children.  Every year close to 30,000 children are lost to stillbirth or sudden unexpected infant death, in more than half of these cases there is no known cause. America is the wealthiest nation in the world, yet our high infant mortality rate ranks 26th out of 29 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member states. Passage of this legislation is a strong step towards lowering our infant mortality rate and ensuring more children can live long productive lives.

During negotiations for the 2014 Farm Bill, I fought to make sure it included programs and policies that work for North Dakota farmers and producers. Now that the new programs are starting to take effect, it’s critical that North Dakotans have the resources they need to fully understand the new policies. Now through February, the Farm Service Agency is holding informational meetings all across the state to answer your questions about the 2014 Farm Bill and learn how it could impact you. Click below to find a meeting time and location near you.
Honored to nominate three outstanding students, Jessica Brodeur and Justin Kovich from Minot, and Barrett Sogard from Williston for admission to the nation’s military service academies. North Dakota is home to some of the best, and brightest students and these three are the cream of the crop. Jessica, Justin and Barrett have the determination, work ethic and ambition that will help them succeed at our nation’s military service academies.

What's better than mashed potatoes, turkey, and grandma's apple pie? How about getting the health care you need when you need it.

Had lots of fun yesterday visiting some of our local small businesses with Little Boxes and Commissioner Nick Fish!   Taking the time to shop locally during the holidays is a simple step to help our small businesses thrive. Small businesses are key to our economic success, and I encourage everyone to spend Thanksgiving celebrating family and friends and then take some time during the weekend to explore and shop Oregon’s small businesses.
I have always said that if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings. Gayle and I were so pleased to celebrate one of America’s greatest holidays with members of our community by serving a wonderful Thanksgiving meal at Union Mission Crossroads Shelter.
Balanced Rock in North Salem may look like a precarious rock formation, but the 60 ton pink granite boulder won't budge. #NYtownoftheday

The Griz and the Cats both kickoff their FCS playoff bids this Saturday, but many Montanans won’t have a chance to watch the games.  I’m calling on ESPN to make the games more widely available, so more Montana football fans can cheer on their teams this weekend. http://1.usa.gov/1vOuAP2
Safe travels to everyone who is on the road or in the air today. Jill and I wish you all a wonderful Thanksgiving!
