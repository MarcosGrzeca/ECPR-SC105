ICYMI: The Cap Times editorial on Tammy's appointment to the Appropriations Committee:
The holiday season is a time to reflect and be grateful for all the blessings we have. I want to thank our servicemembers who selflessly sacrifice so that we can enjoy our blessings with our loved ones. Please join me to extend our warmest wishes to all military families this holiday season.   Watch my holiday greeting to our servicemembers then LIKE and SHARE to thank them for their sacrifice and wish them a joyous holiday season!
UPDATE: The President has signed the bill creating Rhode Island's first national historic park, along the Blackstone River.  Proud to have led the effort in Congress to get this done - great news for RI!  http://www.providencejournal.com/news/government/20141220-obama-signs-bill-for-national-park-along-the-blackstone-river.ece
