Stan Musial was a great baseball player and an excellent representative for our state.
"Stan Musial was a national treasure that St Louis was happy to share. No one was more deserving of the love and respect that all of us had for the man, our man, Stan the man, Stan the gentleman. We all send our sympathy to the entire Musial family. There will never be another one like him. Heaven is now home to the perfect swing, the ready smile, and some darn fine harmonica tunes." - Claire
Every Presidential Inauguration is a special occasion for us to celebrate the American spirit and a renewal of our commitment to the continuing pursuit of ‘a more perfect’ union. It is fitting that President Obama will swear his oath of office on two Bibles, one that belonged to Dr. King, the other to President Lincoln, two great and martyred champions of liberty and justice for all. It is equally fitting that the celebration of this Inauguration include a National Day of Service because the Scriptures that inspired both Dr. King and President Lincoln are filled with exhortations for all of us to love our neighbors as ourselves. That is something we in West Virginia know a lot about because the people of our great state are like a big family. Caring for each other is part of our heritage, and service to our communities, our state and our country.
Game day! Go Pats!
