Senator Shaheen released the following statement this evening on the passing of former First Lady Catherine Gregg:   "Catherine Gregg was a devoted mother and wife who as New Hampshire's First Lady, displayed the type of commitment and love for our state that eventually came to define the entire Gregg family. The fact that her service continued for decades after she and former Governor Gregg left office underscored just how deeply she cared about New Hampshire. My thoughts are with the Gregg family during this difficult time."    -JS
