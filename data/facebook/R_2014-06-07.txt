Such a privilege to honor the extraordinary bravery of First Lieutenant Donald Schwab of Hooper, Nebraska, who received the Medal of Honor posthumously in March for his heroic acts of service during World War II. Today I joined U.S. Senator Mike Johanns, members of the Schwab family, including Donald's wife Maralee, and many other guests to unveil First Lt. Schwab's name on the Nebraska Medal of Honor plaque during a ceremony at the Capitol in Lincoln. Americans are forever grateful for the service and sacrifice of Donald Schwab and all our courageous men and women in uniform.

It was great to spend the evening with many FHSU alumni and supporters as we celebrated the FHSU's outstanding achievements. This year’s dinner was bittersweet, as it was the last for FHSU President Dr. Edward Hammond. Here, I'm pictured with Dr. Hammond and incoming president Dr. Mirta Martin.
