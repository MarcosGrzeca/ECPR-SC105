Today, all Hoosiers are appalled by the tragic murder of Peter Kassig, and we mourn with his family and loved ones. Peter heroically served his country in uniform, and we celebrate this Hoosierâ€™s life of sacrifice and benevolent service to others. It is truly a tragedy that a man who sought to help those in need had his life cut short by savage barbarians who terrorize the innocent.  The unspeakable depravities ISIS continues to commit are a blatant distortion of the Muslim faith and a cancer on the civilized world. Defeating this so-called caliphate will be a long and protracted effort that requires a resolute commitment from the United States. We must not let this momentary triumph of evil ultimately prevail.
Utmost tragedy that those like Peter Kassig, who seek to help needy, are treated savagely by barbarians who terrorize the innocent.
