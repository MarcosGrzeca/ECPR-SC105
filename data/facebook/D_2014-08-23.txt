"We extend our condolences to the family, many friends and all the people Bob Herkes steadfastly served as a Hawai`i County Council member and Hawai`i State legislator.  Bob was a plain spoken leader who was simultaneously business and community minded.  His colleagues always sought his opinion because he was smart, balanced and valued the facts.  The more I got to know him, the more I understood his compassion for people most in need and his deep love for our island home.  Bob brought a broad talent to public service and he will be missed.‚Äù - BES
