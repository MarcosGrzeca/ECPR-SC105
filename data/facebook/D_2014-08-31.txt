NM-14: No wonder it's a Scenic Byway.
Only two days left to enjoy the Great New York State Fair! #NYSFair
"Skippa profoundly impacted the lives of countless youths throughout his decades-long teaching and coaching career, particularly in his hometown of Kalihi. A true larger than life figure, Skippa earned the respect of people from all walks of life, and his legendary size and strength were only matched by his heart and compassion for others. My sincerest condolences go out to his wife, Mary, and the rest of the Diaz ohana." - BES  http://www.staradvertiser.com/sports/breaking/20140830_Hawaii_football_legend_Skippa_Diaz_dies.html?id=273321421
