Today, I continued my statewide listening tour in Lincoln at the Sunrise Café. I enjoyed the opportunity to visit with nearly 40 area residents about the economy, health care and internet governance.   Thanks to Trooper Brent Van Buren and Lincoln Co. Sheriff Mike Weigel for attending. Thanks also to Jo Buttenhoff for allowing me to hold the meeting at the Café. The work I do in Washington and the issues I focus on are largely based on the conversations I have with Kansans. Check my website for upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops.
It's good to be in North Central Kansas today. I'm in Lincoln hosting another Kansas Listening Tour stop to hear from area residents about the issues facing Kansas and the country.
Glad that 82 Ohio veterans could travel to D.C. this weekend to visit their World War II Memorial. #HonorFlight
