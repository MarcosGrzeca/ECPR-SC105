Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King participated in a wreath laying ceremony at the foot of the U.S. Capitol in honor of America’s military service members and their families who are separated during the holiday season. The event was led by the Maine State Society in conjunction with Wreaths Across America and the wreath will remain on display throughout the holidays. Both Senators delivered brief remarks during the ceremony.  “Since its inception 23 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project has become an annual tradition of placing Maine balsam fir remembrance wreaths on the graves of our fallen heroes,” said Senator Collins. “Wreaths Across America honors our departed heroes, but it does even more. It tells the Veterans still with us that we honor their service. It tells our men and women in uniform today that we are grateful for their courage and devotion to duty. It tells the families of those serving our country that they are in our thoughts and prayers. And it tells the families of the fallen that we share their grief.”

We are all grateful for your courage, devotion to duty, and sacrifice.  And I give thanks to your families and loved ones, for they too, make a great sacrifice.   I am also thankful for family and friends, and for all of the people throughout our great state who use their time and talents to make a real difference in their communities. You help make Maine such a special place to live.  Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family!
