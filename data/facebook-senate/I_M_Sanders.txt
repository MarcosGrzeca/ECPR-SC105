Fight for Our Progressive Vision - Sen. Bernie Sanders, The Huffington Post:  As I look ahead to this coming year, a number of thoughts come to mind.  First and foremost, against an enormous amount of corporate media noise and distraction, it is imperative that we not lose sight of what is most important and the vision that we stand for. We have got to stay focused on those issues that impact the lives of tens of millions of Americans who struggle every day to keep their heads above water economically, and who worry deeply about the kind of future their kids will have.  Yes. We make no apologies in stating that the great moral, economic and political issue of our time is the growing level of income and wealth inequality in our nation. It is a disgrace to everything this country is supposed to stand for when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, and when one family (the Waltons) owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent. No. The economy is not sustainable when the middle class continues to disappear and when 95 percent of all new income generated since the Wall Street crash goes to the top 1 percent. In order to create a vibrant economy, working families need disposable income. That is often not the case today.

The Week in Review:   Home for the holidays in Vermont, Sen. Bernie Sanders sat down on Tuesday with WCAX-TV’s Kyle Midura to discuss state and national issues ranging from an exciting new early childhood education program in Vermont to a lingering strike by 1,700 workers in northern New England against a major Internet and phone service provider for the region.  On Monday, Sanders spoke with WBUR-FM in Boston about a host of national issues including how he will use his new assignment as the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee to fend off Republican attacks on Social Security and Medicare.

An Unsung Heroine:  “Gretchen Bailey is an unsung heroine,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders. He was describing the Senate office’s casework coordinator whose last day on the job was Monday.  Bailey led a team that has helped tens of thousands of Vermonters cut through red tape. Sometimes the federal bureaucracy needs a nudge and “that’s what we do,” she once said. Earlier this year, she won a prestigious award for exemplary public service.  “Gretchen strongly believes that government should work for people,” Sanders wrote a letter nominating her for the award. “Gretchen has dedicated her life to this mission.”  Read more about Gretchen: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/vermont/helping-one-vermonter-at-a-time

The Week in Review:   The People’s Climate March drew 400,000 demonstrators, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, to New York on Sunday. The massive turnout on the eve of a UN General Assembly meeting showed widespread support for bold government action to reverse global warming. On Friday, Sanders said strong majorities of Americans also want action on other critical issues – from jobs to income and wealth inequality to raising the minimum wage – but Republicans in Congress have blocked progress. “Ordinary Americans understand that the economy today is not doing well for the middle class or working families,” Sanders said on his weekly radio and Internet program with Thom Hartmann. “People know that the middle class is disappearing. They know more people are living in poverty and that the wealthy and large corporations are doing phenomenally well. And they want the government to take action.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-092614

The Great Divide: Life in McDowell County:   There is tremendous inequality in the United States today. Unemployment is much too high, wages and income are too low, millions of Americans are struggling to find affordable health care, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider.  One of the most striking examples of this inequality is the large and widening gap in life expectancy that exists around this country. Within a state or even within a single city, life expectancy can vary widely depending on the neighborhood. Every American is affected by these disparities. The U.S. spends more on health care than any other country in the world; however, Americans in nearly all age groups and in all social classes have shorter life expectancies than their counterparts in 16 other high-income countries (Institute of Medicine, 2013).

Pain at the Pump:   As Vermonters returned home Labor Day from visiting with friends and family, many faced the frustrating reality that filling up in northwestern Vermont cost about $5 more than elsewhere in Vermont. In Rutland, for example, gas could be purchased last week for little more than $3.30 a gallon. Meanwhile, people filling up in St. Albans and Burlington were forced to pay about 30 cents more per gallon. The cost to fuel distributors to haul gas 75 miles adds about a nickel to the price of a gallon of gas, according to a pricing expert at the Oil Price Information Service. In other words, there is no economic justification for gas in northwestern Vermont to cost 30 cents more a gallon than in Rutland.

From 2010 to 2011, Tonya was stationed in Basra, Iraq fixing radios and tracking systems for the National Guard. Not long after her return home, Tonya found herself living in her pick-up truck in “random parking lots.” That’s when the Dodge House, which provides transitional housing to homeless veterans, gave her a home – and the guidance she needed to figure out the next steps in her life. “It’s a family here,” Tonya said, calling executive director Chris Morgan “not only a friend, but kind of a parent.”   Watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v-uVaMwbkU

Bernie Sanders supports a constitutional amendment that the Senate will vote on in September. On Thursday, President Barack Obama signed into law a bill by Sanders to help veterans get timely access to quality health care. The crime was worse than the fine, Sanders said after reports on Wednesday that Bank of America agreed to pay $17 billion for its role in the 2008 economic crisis.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Spying on Congress: Central Intelligence Agency employees improperly searched computers used by Senate staffers probing the agency's interrogation techniques, the director acknowledged last week. In January, the National Security Agency refused to directly answer Sen. Bernie Sanders when he asked if it was spying on members of Congress. “The people’s control of their own government … is jeopardized if the machinery of the state is monitoring the private communications of the people who are supposed to be controlling it,” the Union Leader of Manchester, New Hampshire, said in an editorial.   VA Compromise: “Our politicians must stop thinking of compromise as a dirty word … Happily, we've seen at least one recent indication that the two parties can work together: the passage of a compromise agreement drafted by Sen. Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller … will make the VA more accountable and help to recruit more doctors, nurses and health care professionals,” Douglas Schoen and Jessica Tarlov wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Times.   Affordable Housing Draws Middle Class: The country’s fastest-growing cities are now those where housing is more affordable than average. Among people who have moved long distances, the number of those who cite housing as their primary motivation for doing so has more than doubled since 2007. Oklahoma City, for example, has become the 12th-fastest-growing city last year. Other affordable cities that have jumped in the growth rankings include several in Texas, including El Paso and San Antonio, as well as Columbus, Ohio, and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to The New York Times.   Food Labels: Ben & Jerry’s support of the nation’s first law requiring labeling of foods made with GMO pits the ice-cream maker against the world’s biggest food companies, including its own corporate parent. Unilever has openly opposed state efforts to legislate GMO labeling, throwing money into campaigns to defeat an initiative in California. But it has quietly allowed Ben & Jerry’s to assert itself as a vocal proponent of such laws, especially in Vermont, Bloomberg reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders on VA Bill: Sen. Bernie Sanders said new legislation passed this past week should go a long way toward clearing up long delays some veterans have been seeing when they seek medical care from Veterans Affairs health centers, The Associated Press reported in an article published in Sunday’s Times Argus and broadcast on WPTZ-TV.   Veterans Clout Breaks Capitol Gridlock: Veterans, a group with demonstrated political clout, were able to break through Congress' customary gridlock. Sen. Sanders shepherded the veterans bill through the Senate in his capacity as Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, AP reported from Washington.   ‘Common Sense’: After the Sanders-McCain bill passed in the Senate last June, Sanders worked out another agreement with Rep.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  A Rare Accomplishment: “As Congress has lurched and stumbled from one crisis to another … a deal forged by Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont’s independent senator, stands as a rare accomplishment,” the Rutland Herald and Times Argus declared in an editorial on Saturday.

Sanders is one of the biggest supporters of employee stock ownership plans, The New Republic reported.

The Week in Review:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday called for millions of Americans to mobilize support for a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United.

The Senate on Thursday approved and sent to President Barack Obama a bill by Sanders to improve access to health care for veterans and reform the Department of Veterans Affairs. And in testimony on Wednesday at the EPA and at a Capitol Hill news conference, Sanders strongly endorsed an Obama administration proposal to reduce carbon emissions at the nation’s power plants.

Curbing Power Plant Pollution: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/curbing-power-plant-pollution
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Secretary Confirmed: Robert McDonald, President Barack Obama’s nominee to be the next Veterans Affairs secretary, was confirmed by the Senate Tuesday as Congress prepared to vote on a major bipartisan VA reform bill. The 97-0 confirmation vote came as Congress was poised to approve a $17 billion bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller to refurbish the VA and improve veterans' health care, The Associated Press reported.   Why Do You Want This Job?: With his confirmation, McDonald may have been handed the biggest challenge of his life: responsibility for leading a vast federal agency scarred by bureaucratic dysfunction. The previous secretary, Eric Shinseki, resigned under intense bipartisan criticism. The agency was left with such a long list of problems that Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders bluntly asked McDonald at a confirmation hearing last week, “'Why do you want this job?” McDonald, whose life has been a procession of increasingly demanding leadership roles, replied: ''If not me, who?'' according to The New York Times.   House Set to Take Up $17 Billion VA Reform Bill: With a new Veterans Affairs secretary in place, Congress is likely to move quickly to approve a bill to refurbish the VA and improve veterans' health care.

Corporate Deserters: Lawmakers are growing tired of corporate America's persistent efforts to dodge U.S. taxes. In the past month, Congress and the White House have denounced a loophole that lets companies lower their tax rate by moving their headquarters overseas. Now, a group of Democrats in Congress want to make sure that any company that incorporates overseas would be barred from doing business with the government. Sen. Carl Levin who introduced the bill in the Senate with Sen. Richard Durbin, The Washington Post reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/073014

Must Read: Banks Cash In on Inversion Deals Intended to Elude Taxes - The New York Times: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/banks-cash-in-on-inversion-deals-intended-to-elude-taxes
Planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war. So is taking care of the men and women who use those weapons and fight our wars. If we can spend $600 billion a year on the military, we can spend 2 percent of that on legislation that will significantly improve the lives of our veterans and their families.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Deal Reached on VA: Bill House and Senate negotiators announced agreement Monday on legislation that would allocate about $17 billion to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, The New York Times reported. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Senate committee chairman, likened the spending to important national security funding. ”Planes and tanks and guns are a cost of war,” Sanders said. “'So is taking care of the men and women who use those weapons and fight our battles.” the bill is likely to pass this week, Sanders said on PBS. It would be a “total disgrace: not to pass the bill, he added on MSNBC.   Congressional Passage Likely Soon: The sweeping proposal to revamp the Department of Veterans Affairs and the nation's medical care for military veterans should have enough support to pass the House and Senate this week before lawmakers leave town for a summer recess, according to The Washington Post. “Whether you're a conservative Republican or a progressive, people understand that this issue should and must go beyond politics,” Sanders said. “We have people who have put their lives on the line who have come back with a whole lot of problems, and it would be an absolute disgrace to this country if we did not address them.” “This bill should and must go beyond politics,” Sanders said on The NBC Nightly News.   The Dealmaker: As chairman of the Senate veterans committee, Sanders embraced his role as a legislative dealmaker, navigating negotiations with Sen. John McCain and Rep. Miller on bipartisan bills to address problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Roll Call reported. Sanders’ “tenacity and passion on behalf of America’s veterans cannot be questioned,” McCain said.   ‘A Coup for Sanders’: At a time when Congress is seemingly unable to agree on even the most basic policies, the VA breakthrough surprised even the most cynical on Capitol Hill and gave hope that Congress can compromise on big issues if the consequences are steep enough and time is running out. The deal “presents a coup for Sanders … a fiery liberal who is contemplating a bid for president in 2016, has demonstrated his bare-knuckle brand of politics can bring … bipartisan accomplishments,” according to Politico.

Bernie Sanders’ New Title: Dealmaker:   Sen. Bernard Sanders didn’t seem a likely suspect to bridge Washington’s toxic partisan divide and cut one of the most significant deals in years.  But the Senate’s lone socialist and a potential 2016 presidential candidate did just that — negotiating a deal over the weekend to tackle wait times at the Department of Veterans Affairs and clear his biggest legislative test since he took over the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee gavel last year.  The Vermont independent’s compromise with House Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla., would provide $17 billion to the agency with $5 billion offset with savings and fees elsewhere. In a brief interview after a Monday news conference announcing the deal, Sanders reflected on the difficulty of the deal.  “I learned that it’s very, very, very hard; that there are a lot of moving parts; that there a lot of people you have to pay attention to,” he said. “In this case with the VA, the administration, the Democrats, with Republicans and a whole lot of individuals within those entities. It’s tough stuff.”  Continue reading here: http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/socialist-sanders-legislates-va-healthcare-deal/?dcz=

 Deal Reached on VA Reform: The chairmen of the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs committees have reached a tentative agreement on a plan to improve veterans' health care. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller have scheduled a news conference on Monday to talk about their compromise plan, The Associated Press and Reuters reported.
 
 Weekend Negotiations ‘Made Significant Progress’: Sen. Sanders and Rep. Miller continued negotiating over the weekend. Aides said they "made significant progress" on legislation to overhaul the VA and provide funding to hire more doctors, nurses and other health-care professionals, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, Reuters, Bloomberg, Congressional Quarterly/Roll Call, Politico and Military.com reported.
 
 Restoring VA’s Reputation: While the VA enjoys a generally good reputation for the quality of its health care, a combination of factors — including a shortage of doctors and nurses, unrealistic goals to see patients within 14 days, and perverse performance and bonus incentives for managers — led to the widespread manipulation of patient wait-time data, which blew up into a national scandal this spring and was a motivating force behind the compromise legislation by Sen. Sanders and Rep. Miller, The New York Times reported.
 
 Compromise Addresses VA Treatment Delays: Sen. Sanders said the compromise will address short- and long-term needs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been under intense criticism after delayed treatment at VA hospitals, The CBS Evening News, CBS Morning News reported. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences. NPR's Ron Elving on Morning Edition said an unanswered question is how Congress would pay for this.

Negotiations Back on Track Negotiations between Senate Democrats and House Republicans seemingly broke down on Thursday but appeared to be on much better ground as of the weekend, with staffers from both sides resuming discussions. Sanders and his house counterpart, House VA Chair Jeff Miller, agreed to fly back to Washington, D.C., if it would push the negotiations forward, Vox reported.

The court ordered the city to allow residents to carry handguns outside their homes and to let nonresidents carry them as well. In 2008, the Supreme Court struck down the District of Columbia’s all-out ban on handguns on the basis that it violated the right to bear arms guaranteed by the Constitution’s Second Amendment, Reuters reported.

The Week in Review:  Sen. Bernie Sanders calls them “corporate deserters” – American companies that dodge U.S. taxes by exploiting a law that lets them pretend, for tax purposes, to be based overseas.  Earlier Friday, Sanders spoke in Philadelphia to the National Association of Letter Carriers about the need to modernize the Postal Service and beat back efforts to cut jobs and services. As chairman of the Senate veterans committee, Sanders steered President Obama’s nominee to head the VA through the committee confirmation process on Wednesday. That tees up a vote in the full Senate in the coming week. At a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Republicans complained about an EPA proposal to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The Republicans’ denial of overwhelming scientific evidence, Sanders said, is “frightening.”  Continue reading The Week in Review: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-072514

 Sanders’ VA Proposal: Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate veterans committee, on Thursday announced a proposal that would cost about $25 billion over three years to lease new clinics, hire thousands of doctors and nurses, and make it easier for veterans who can't get prompt appointments with VA doctors to get outside care. He offered to trim the cost of a Senate-passed bill to improve health care services at the VA to $25 billion over three years, The Associated Press, Reuters, CBS Radio and Bloomberg Radio reported.
 
 Miller’s VA Proposal: Rep. Jeff Miller, the House committee chairman, said a partisan meeting he staged on Thursday to offer his proposal for VA reform was not a “take-it-or-leave-it offer,” Roll Call, Military.com, Military Times and Talk Radio News Service reported.
 
 Veterans for VA Reform: The nation's major veterans groups back a Department of Veterans Affairs request for more doctors and nurses and additional space at hospitals and clinics, but House Republicans on Thursday insisted that would not improve veterans’ access to health services, The Washington Post reported. Sen. Sanders disagreed with the House. “The major veterans’ organizations have been clear about the needs of the VA,” the Senate veterans’ committee chairman said. “It is time for the House to pay attention."
 
 VA Reform: The House and Senate veterans committee chairmen offered competing proposals Thursday to fix the VA health care system, The Associated Press and Brattleboro Reformer reported. “We have put good faith offers on the table, again and again, and have tried to meet the Republicans more than halfway,” Sanders in The Wall Street Journal, the Burlington Free Press, Times Argus and Rutland Herald. “But I am sad to say that at this point I can only conclude, with great reluctance, that the good faith we have shown is simply not being reciprocated.” In Bloomberg report, Sanders said House Republican leaders are “not serious about negotiations.”

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans Back Funding for VA Doctors: The nation’s major veterans groups on Wednesday called on Congress to stop penny-pinching and back increased funding for more doctors, nurses and space at VA facilities, The Associated Press, Roll Call and The Hill reported. Sen. Bernie Sanders said a the House and Senate should include some of the department’s requested funds in a bill to increase health care capacity at VA facilities, Military Times and WCAX-TV reported.   House Veterans Chairman at Odds with Veterans: Sen. Sanders, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman, supports the VA’s funding proposal while his counterpart, House Veterans Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller, opposes doing so. "We urge Congress to expeditiously approve supplemental funding that fully addresses the critical needs outlined by Secretary Gibson either prior to, or at the same time as, any compromise legislation that may be reported out of the House-Senate Conference Committee," the joint letter reads, according to Congressional Quarterly.   McCain: Gridlock on VA ‘Unconscionable’ and ‘Embarrassing’: When Sen. John McCain joined Sen. Sanders in crafting a bill to restructure the Department of Veterans Affairs, he pleaded with his colleagues to not derail the compromise.The Senate quickly passed the Sanders-McCain bill with bipartisan support. Now, nearly 45 days later, the squabbling that McCain warned about has come to pass. “It is unconscionable,” McCain told The Huffington Post “It is embarrassing.

Why Do You Want this Job?: After listing a litany of problems facing the VA, Sen. Sanders asked McDonald why he wants the job. “I think I can make a difference," the West Point graduate said in The Wall Street Journal. Sanders suggested jokingly that senators didn't want to say anything to scare McDonald into running out of the hearing room, The Washington Post reported. Sanders said he was impressed by McDonald's military and business backgrounds, the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Times and UPI reported. McDonald is well aware of the department’s problems, Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press. McDonald said he would take action on reforms during his first 90 days in office, National Journal reported.   VA Reform: Sen. Sanders said lawmakers tasked with creating bipartisan legislation to overhaul the VA have agreed to offset parts of the eventual bill with spending cuts, The Hill  reported.

Climate Change: Coverage of climate change on network television has markedly increased in the six months since Sen. Sanders and eight Democratic senators sent a letter to network news executives criticizing a lack of coverage on Sunday morning talk shows, The Hill reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans Health Care: The House and Senate are still trying to break a logjam over concerns about the cost of reforming the Veterans Affairs Department. The aim is to get a bill to the president before recess, National Journal reported. House Veterans' Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said he is willing to consider a deal that is not totally offset in cost, and is hoping for some give from his Senate counterpart, Bernard Sanders, according to Congressional Quarterly.   Tax Deserters: Corporate inversions, the practice of U.S. companies reincorporating overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, have moved from the margins of the tax code to the midterm campaigns as Democrats are attempting to put heat on Republicans. A new push from the White House last week elevated the issue and mobilized a Democratic drive for immediate legislation to tighten the rules on the practice, in which U.S. corporations relocate to a tax-friendlier place such as the U.K. or Ireland, usually through a merger with a smaller foreign company, The Wall Street Journal reported.   Wealth Gap Growing, But Poor Women Having Healthier Newborns: Something extraordinary is happening to poor pregnant women: They’re giving birth to healthier babies. While other economic and health disparities have widened, giving way to huge national debates about inequality, pregnant women at the lowest rung of the nation’s economic ladder are bucking that trend, according to The Washington Post.   Training Doctors: Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson told a Senate committee last week that he needed $17.6 billion over the next three years to hire some 1,500 doctors, 8,500 nurses and other clinicians to reduce the unconscionably long waiting times that many veterans now endure before they are able to see a doctor. That news was bad enough, but the department’s problems are emblematic of an even deeper problem: a nationwide shortage of doctors, especially primary care doctors, and other health care professionals, that will only get worse in coming years,” The New York Times said in an editorial.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Medical Mistakes: A Senate hearing Thursday on preventable deaths in hospitals “was a low-key, measured but damning two-hour exploration of how huge numbers of people needlessly die,” James Warren wrote in Sunday’s New York Daily News. “We’ve not moved the needle in any demonstrable way. We are not substantially better off than we were,” Adish Jha of the Harvard School of Public Health told a panel chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was alluding to a landmark study that concluded 100,000 hospital patients die yearly due to totally preventable medical mistakes. That was nearly 15 years ago.  Veterans: A program that allows veterans with traumatic brain injuries to receive treatment in assisted living facilities is in danger of closing down. The pilot program that expires Sept. 30. An extension was proposed by Sen. Sanders, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, a bill that Senate Republicans blocked earlier this year. Sanders said last week that he was unsure an extension would be included in a VA bill now in conference committee. “I just can’t tell you at this point — we’re into some pretty tough negotiations — I can’t give a definitive answer on whether or not it gets into this bill,” he told The Hill. Asked if lawmakers could approve a temporary measure to extend the effort’s life, Sanders said: “The answer is yes and it’s something we’ll take a hard look at.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/072014

The Week in Review:   Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an attempt to protect the rights of women workers to company-sponsored health care benefits. A Senate panel chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday heard testimony about the third leading cause of death in America: preventable medical mistakes by hospitals. There was a huge outpouring of public comments before a midnight Friday deadline on a Federal Communications Commission plan that would doom net neutrality. Also on Friday, in an unabashed scheme to evade U.S. taxes, a giant U.S. drug company announced plans to take over a big foreign rival and shift the corporate headquarters to Great Britain. One way to treat corporate deserters like that, Sanders said, is to bar them from any U.S. government contracts.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Corporate Deserters: The pharmaceutical giant AbbVie agreed on Friday to buy its European rival, Shire, and reincorporate in Britain in order to cut its taxes. Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed legislation to bar companies that leave America from receiving federal contracts, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported. “I have a message for these corporate deserters: You can’t be an American company only when you want corporate welfare from American taxpayers or you want lucrative contracts from the federal government,” Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press. “This is an absolute outrage. It really is,” Sanders said on WCAX-TV, which reported that Mylan Pharmaceuticals, a company with a plant in St. Albans, Vermont, is one of the latest companies to make a move merging with Abbott Laboratories and reincorporating in the Netherlands.   Obama to Protect Gay Workers: President Barack Obama plans to sign executive orders Monday prohibiting discrimination against gay and transgender workers in the federal government and in the workforces of federal contractors. “The president is right. We’ve got to end LGBT discrimination in the workplace. Congress should have acted long ago, but Republicans have blocked action,” Sen. Sanders said in a Facebook post.

The president is right. We’ve got to end LGBT discrimination in the workplace. Vermont did this 22 years ago when it passed one of the first state laws in the country protecting lesbian and gay workers. Congress should have acted long ago, but Republicans have blocked action. The House won’t even allow a vote on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act  that the Senate passed last year. That’s why the executive order that President Obama is singing on Monday is an important step in the right direction. - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Preventable Deaths Rampant in Hospitals: Preventable medical errors in hospitals are the third leading cause of death in the United States, experts told a Senate panel chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday, ProPublica, The Wall Street Journal, Modern Healthcare and WVNY-TV reported. As many as 440,000 people die each year from preventable medical errors in hospitals. Sanders said the current system in hospitals as dysfunctional, profit oriented and not patient centered.   VA Reform: Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson's funding request for $17.6 billion has complicated negotiations over the VA bill, according to Politico, Bloomberg and Cronkite News Service. Sen. Sanders said he recognizes increasing health care access for veterans comes with a “very big price tag” but argued Congress needs to allocate resources to solve the immediate crisis caused by long wait times. Rep. Jeff Miller scoffed at the $17.6 billion number, saying it "seems to have magically fallen out of the sky," Military News reported.   Expanding Social Security: Expanding Social Security is once again a mainstream part of the Democratic platform. Some progressive voices in Congress, including Sen. Sanders, have been behind these reforms all along, William Greider wrote for The Nation.   Cost of War: “Congress' effort to quickly deal with the crisis plaguing the health care system run by the Department of Veterans Affairs promised to be a swift triumph of bipartisan cooperation, bringing together two unlikely sponsors, Sens. Sanders and John McCain. But congratulations were cut short by a Congressional Budget Office analysis that the Sanders-McCain bill might cost as much as $50 billion annually,” Ross K. Baker wrote in a USA Today column.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/071814
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Caring for Veterans: Fixing problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs will cost $17.6 billion over the next three years, Sloan Gibson, the acting secretary, testified on Wednesday at a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing. Sen. Bernard Sanders, the committee chairman, told The New York Times that the sums discussed by Gibson would fix underlying problems that would persist and grow worse if they are not addressed now.   More Docs Needed: With more than 600,000 veterans still waiting at least a month for appointments and about 8,000 waiting at least four months, Sanders said there is “an immediate crisis” and asked Acting Secretary Gibson, “What are the legitimate needs?” CNN reported. The VA needs to hire 10,000 doctors, nurses and other health care providers and make other reforms in order to meet the needs of a growing number of veterans, Gibson told Sanders, USA Today, the Burlington Free Press, Rutland Herald, Times Argus, Military Times, National Journal and The Reno Dispatch reported. Gibson said he believes the department can regain the trust of veterans with significant reforms, The Associated Press and The Washington Times noted.   Refugee Crisis: The pace of migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border has slowed in recent weeks, administration officials told lawmakers Wednesday. A growing number of congressional Democrats are opposed to weakening legal protections for young children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America. Sen. Sanders told Ed Schultz Wednesday on MSNBC that child refugees fleeing violence into the United States should be afforded safe and humane housing as well as all legal protections required by current law. “We have a refugee crisis,” Sanders said. “It is a moral issue. Do you simply shove them back to where they came from? I don’t think that’s what America’s supposed to be about.”   Net Neutrality: A Federal Communications Commission proposal to alter net neutrality rules governing Internet service corporations has received nearly 800,000 comments. Sen. Sanders joined a handful of Senate colleagues in telling the FCC to regulate broadband companies as utilities,Gauthum Nagesh blogged for The Wall Street Journal.

VA Details Health Care Needs:   The Department of Veterans Affairs needs $17.6 billion to hire 10,000 doctors, nurses and other health care providers and make other reforms in order to meet the needs of a growing number of veterans and reduce long waiting times for health care, Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson told the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs on Wednesday. Gibson was responding to a question by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chairman, about what the VA needs to address a large influx of veterans needing treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and other health care needs. Without the resources to deal with veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gibson said, “the wait times just get longer.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/va-details-health-care-needs
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Dark Money: Undisclosed political spending known as “dark money” threatens to fundamentally undermine American democracy as high-dollar, secret donors increasingly influence elections, Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ronan Farrow Tuesday on MSNBC. “Republicans understand what is at stake here and what they want is to have the billionaires be able to put as much money into the political process as possible and without disclosure,” Sanders said.   Americans Overwhelm FCC Website: A Federal Communications Commission comments webpage buckled under pressure Tuesday as thousands of Americans rushed to file comments on the commission’s proposed Internet regulations. The commission extended Tuesday’s deadline until midnight Friday. Sen. Sanders joined 12 other senators in urging FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to stop Internet providers from creating ‘fast lanes’ for deep-pocketed corporations, the Times Argus, WPTZ-TV, a Washington Post blog, UPI, The Hill, Politico, TechCrunch, MultiChannel News, CIO Magazine, Daily Kos and PCWorld reported.  VA Nominee: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders announced that the panel will hold a confirmation hearing next week to hear from Robert McDonald, President Barack Obama’s nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, The Hill, Politico, Cincinnati Enquirer, Military Times and WSJV-TV in South Bend, Indiana, reported. “I look forward to the hearing with Mr. McDonald and hope that his confirmation will give the VA the long-term leadership that it needs,” Sanders said.   CBO Sees Medicare's Financial Picture Improving: The biggest Medicare program is expected to remain financially solvent through 2030, five years longer than previously expected, according to a government estimate released Tuesday that predicts the program's health-care costs will grow more slowly than they did before the recession. The report by the Congressional Budget Office said Medicare's financial picture had improved sharply, according to The New York Times.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Net Neutrality: A letter to the Federal Communications Commission signed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and others was part of what The Hill called an avalanche of net neutrality comments highlighting the passions stirred over whether Internet service providers like Comcast should be allowed to charge companies more money for quicker delivery of their movies and television shows. Sens. Sanders, Ed Markey, Chuck Schumer and Al Franken urged the FCC to protect public access to online information through a free and open Internet, National Journal reported.

Senate to Vote on Energy Regulators: The Senate today is scheduled to vote on two nominees for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Environment and Energy Publishing reported. Sen. Sanders was the only dissenting vote against Cheryl LaFleur, the acting chairman.   New Populism: Sen. Sanders warned that if the American people chose not to vote and let corporations and billionaires sway election outcomes, the country would become an oligarchy, Ring of Fire reported. “The dynamics of American democracy today is that the vast majority of people don’t vote, lower income and working-class people — in very large numbers — don’t vote, and the billionaire class is in the process of buying and selling politicians. That’s where we are today, Sanders said.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/071514

The Third Leading Cause of Death in the U.S.   Heart disease and cancer are the two leading causes of death in the United States.  People are often surprised to learn that as many as 400,000 people die each year, however, from preventable medical errors in hospitals. That makes medical mistakes in hospitals the third leading cause of death in this country.  “This is a crisis situation which must be dealt with,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging. The subcommittee has scheduled a hearing at 10 a.m. Thursday to discuss this enormously important issue with some of the leading experts in the country.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans: Lawmakers will have a busy week as they review reform efforts at the Veterans Affairs Department. Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson will testify Wednesday before the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, his first appearance on Capitol Hill since scandals over falsified patient wait times forced former Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign in May. The hearings could inform negotiators trying to hammer out a conference bill. President Obama’s nominee for VA secretary, Robert McDonald, will continue meeting with senators ahead of his confirmation hearing. McDonald last week sat down with a handful of lawmakers, including Senate VA panel Chairman Bernie Sanders, who came away impressed by his qualifications, The Hill reported.   Corporate Democrats: “The trend since the 1980s has been economic/environmental decline alongside the solidification of corporate power and economic inequality … The only way to reverse this dangerous trend is to tell the truth about and challenge corporate Democrats … A good place for that challenge to happen would be through a progressive candidate taking on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primaries, if she runs. That challenger might be a Bernie Sanders …,” Jeff Cohen wrote for Common Dreams.   House Hearing on VA Backlog: A House panel on Monday is scheduled to examine the Obama administration’s efforts to eliminate a longstanding backlog of disability claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The hearing, held by the House Veterans Affairs Committee, comes less than two months after federal investigators found widespread manipulation of scheduling numbers at VA medical centers, according to The Washington Post wonkblog.   Governors Slam Inaction on Highway Funding: Governors from both parties voiced incredulity over an impasse in Washington that has jeopardized spending on roads and bridges, calling on lawmakers to come up with the sort of long-term solution that was commonplace in less partisan times. Some governors at their summer meeting, both Democrats and Republicans, said Congress should consider increasing the gas tax to provide a more reliable revenue stream for the Highway Trust Fund. They also called for finding ways to ensure that electric and fuel-efficient vehicles help pay the costs of maintaining the nation's roads, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Land Mines: Sen. Patrick Leahy has pushed for years for the United States to join an international land mine treaty. The White House recently signaled that the U.S. would no longer produce or acquire land mines, but the Obama administration stopped short of saying it would sign the treaty. In the Senate, Leahy got 68 Senate signatures on a 2010 letter imploring Obama to join the convention. “Senator Leahy has been the most forceful and clearest voice in America and a leader internationally in urging the United States to join 161 other countries that have signed a treaty outlawing land mines,” said Sen. Bernard Sanders, who signed the 2010 letter. “Vermonters should be proud that Senator Leahy has pushed our country in the right direction,” Sanders told the Rutland Herald and Times Argus.   Israel Deploys Troops in Gaza: Israel briefly deployed ground troops inside the Gaza Strip for the first time early Sunday as its military warned northern Gaza residents to evacuate their homes, part of a widening offensive that's killed more than 160 Palestinians. As Israel amassed tanks and soldiers at Gaza's borders, The Associated Press said Prime Minister Benjamin Netayahu signaled at a Cabinet meeting on Sunday that a wider ground offensive was possible. "We don't know when the operation will end," he said. "It might take a long time."  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/071314

Tell Bernie your ideas here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/we-need-a-political-revolution  The status of American democracy is frighteningly dismal.    In the coming November elections, it is estimated that 60 percent of Americans will not vote.  Worse, 70-80 percent of those hurting most economically, low and moderate income workers, will not be participating in the election.  Further, political consciousness in this country is extremely low, with most people not knowing who their member of Congress is or which political political parties control the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.  Meanwhile, while tens of millions of American workers have given up on the political process and no longer see government as relevant to their lives, the billionaire class is more active politically than ever before.  As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and other billionaires will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to elect candidates whose main function is to help the wealthiest and most powerful people become even wealthier and more powerful.  In other words, the rich are becoming richer and spend huge sums on political donations.  The poor are becoming poorer and don't even vote.  Our job is to make a political revolution.  Our job is to educate and organize so that working people fight for their rights and for their dignity - and are actively participating in the political process.  When we do that, when we stand together, we win: Health care for all, a fair distribution of wealth and income, a major federal jobs program, higher wages, reversing global warming and real campaign finance reform.    When we give up and don't participate, we lose.  And what we will see is the continued collapse of the middle class and an increase in poverty, cuts in Social Security and Medicare, a growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, no increase in the minimum wage, no effort to make college affordable and more devastation because of global warming.  Please share your ideas with me.  How do we make that political revolution?  How do we bring people together to fight for their rights and a progressive agenda which represents the needs of all Americans, and not just the top 1 percent.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Patchwork Plans Emerge for Roads: Rival stopgap measure to boost a rapidly dwindling transportation trust fund are gaining traction in Congress. Instead of raising new revenue, the House would extend expiring customs fees on importers, transfer money from a fund for leaking underground storage tanks and change rules on private pension contributions. The Senate uses those provisions, but scales back pension changes in favor of better compliance with existing tax laws. Sen. Bernard Sanders, speaking Thursday on the Vermont PBS show “Report from Washington,” called it “insanity” that congressional Republicans refuse to consider raising revenue to shore up the highway fund. “So this is pretty crazy,” he added in the Times Argus and Rutland Herald. “These Republicans are obstructing, obstructing, obstructing.”  Highway Trust Fund: Passing legislation to fund the Highway Trust Fund should pass before Congress leaves Washington for the month-long August recess, Donna Brazile wrote in a syndicated column published by the Portage (Wisconsin) Daily Register and The Fort Morgan (Colorado) Times. She noted that, according to Sen. Sanders, "32 percent of America's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition, and 42 percent of major urban highways remain congested, costing the economy an estimated $101 billion in wasted time and fuel annually."  Cost of War: Members of Congress are scrambling to lower the cost of a bill to fix veterans' health care amid a growing uproar over long waits for appointments and falsification of records to cover up the delays at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, The Associated Press and Military Times reported. The latest analysis by the Congressional Budget Office says a provision granting wider access to health care for veterans could cost about $30 billion over the next three years. “Wars are expensive,” said Sen. Sanders, chair of the Senate veterans committee. “Taking care of the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us is a cost of war."

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  IBM: “Clearly this is a very frightening situation,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Thursday on Vermont PBS in response to reports that IBM may sell off its Vermont operations that employ some 4,000 workers. State officials have worked to make IBM and a company rumored to be buying its microelectronics division aware that Vermont wants to keep the business in the state. Vermont's congressional delegation efforts go back decades. Sanders played a role in securing for the IBM campus a $3 million solar test center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Burlington Free Press reported.   Health Centers: The Department of Health and Human Services announced $100 million in funding for 150 new community health centers. Sen. Bernie Sanders has launched an early effort to renew and boost health center funding through 2020, Roll Call reported   Corporate Welfare: A brewing debate in Congress over the Export-Import Bank – a government agency providing taxpayer subsidized loans to multinational corporations – goes back 15 years ago when then Rep. Sanders tried to construct a left-right coalition to reform the bank. A few libertarians voiced free-market criticism of the bank, but the impetus for reform was primarily among the left. Sanders’ 2002 amendment proposing to restrict the bank’s subsidies garnered only 22 Republican votes but had 111 mostly progressive backers who, like Sanders, saw the Ex-Im Bank as egregious corporate welfare, David SIrota wrote for Salon.   Time to Act on VA: The Congressional Budget Office released a new, lower score for a House bill to overhaul the Veterans Affairs Department. “Wars are expensive and taking care of the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us is a cost of war,” Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said in The Hill. “Congress has been discussing the serious problems at the VA for months. Strong legislation to address the emergency and take care of our veterans must be passed now. It’s time for action.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/071114

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders and the Suits: Trouble at the Department of Veterans Affairs has put a spotlight on Sen. Sanders, the veterans committee chairman. When Sanders first ran for office in the 1970s, he barely got 2 percent of the vote. Now he’s thinking about running for president. To understand why he is so popular, National Public Radio went to the most conservative and poorest part of Vermont, the Northeast Kingdom, where one dairy farmer said he and Sanders don’t agree on everything but he always votes for Sanders because the senator “is not intimidated by well-dressed people with, you know, $2,000 or $3,000 suits. That’s not Bernie. And that’s not us either.”   VA Nominee Praised by Sanders: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders voiced support Wednesday for President Barack Obama’s pick for secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, The Hill, The Cincinnati Enquirer, Talk Radio Service and WCAX-TV reported. “I was impressed by his devotion to veterans, by his service in the military, by his corporate service and knowledge of running a very, very large entity,” Sanders told reporters after meeting the West Point graduate who was the CEO of Proctor & Gamble. Sanders plans to hold a confirmation hearing on the nomination soon, CNN reported.   The Cost of War: The sky-high CBO score for a veterans’ health care overhaul continues to stall progress weeks after separate bills blitzed through the House and Senate. Sen. Sanders told Congressional Quarterly that the cost is an issue but he stressed that it will require money to fix the VA. “We are going to have to make sure that the VA is adequately staffed in terms of doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel,” Sanders continued. “That is going to be an expensive proposition.”   Global Warming: A carbon tax must be a central part of our strategy for dramatically reducing carbon pollution, Sen.

Why We Need a Carbon Tax:  “The scientific community is clear: Global warming is real and it is caused by human activity. In terms of droughts, heat waves, floods, forest fires, disease, rising sea levels and extreme weather disturbances, global warming is already causing devastating problems. The simple truth is that if we do not act boldly and quickly these problems will only get much worse in the years to come. A carbon tax must be a central part of our strategy for dramatically reducing carbon pollution,” Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a column posted Wednesday on The Huffington Post. “I am proud to have joined with Sen. Barbara Boxer, the chair of the environment committee in the Senate, in introducing the Climate Protection Act. Our legislation, which creates a straightforward carbon and methane fee, is the boldest carbon bill ever introduced. Now is the time to rally the American people in support of this bill.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/why-we-need-a-carbon-tax
Today's news from Sen.Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Immigration Emergency: Sen. Bernie Sanders and Vermont’s congressional delegation on Tuesday supported President Barack Obama’s call for $3.7 billion in emergency aid to help deal with an immigration crisis along the United States border with Mexico, Vermont Public Radio reported. Calling it “an urgent humanitarian situation, Obama sought the funds to address a surge of young migrants from Central America crossing the border into Texas. Sanders said it was imperative that the funding isn’t taken from existing refugee resettlement programs.   Road Fund Crisis: The Vermont Agency of Transportation will have to put $100 million worth of bridge, road and rail projects on hold if Congress does not shore up the federal highway trust fund by August 1. Sen. Sanders, who serves on the Senate public works committee, said the trust fund gap could spur the cancellation of 112,000 construction projects and cause 700,000 job losses, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said Tuesday that lawmakers were getting closer to a deal.   Purple Heart: The 80-year-old son of a World War I veteran is going to get the Purple Heart his father earned while fighting in the Great War that began 100 years ago this summer. Vermont National Guard Maj. Gen. Steven Cray, Lt. Gov. Phil Scott will present a Purple Heart award to the family of John H. Demag during a ceremony at the Statehouse on Wednesday. Sen.

Do Republicans Want America to Become a Third World Country?   The federal Highway Trust Fund is expected to go broke in early August unless Congress comes up with a new source of revenue to augment the federal gasoline tax. If the fund dries up, road and bridge construction projects could be put on hold across the country during the peak of the summer construction season. Altogether, an estimated 112,000 construction projects could be cancelled and 700,000 jobs lost.  The Vermont Transportation Agency already has announced that it is poised to delay 38 bridge, rail and road projects.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Higher Wages for Working People Boost the Economy: States where the minimum wage increased this year have experienced higher average job growth than states that did not change their wage laws, according to a new study. Sen. Bernie Sanders said raising the minimum wage would boost pay for some 28 million Americans and stimulate the economy through increased consumer spending. “We need to raise the minimum wage to put real dollars in the hands of working people,” Sanders told the Rev. Al Sharpton during an interview on MSNBC.   Republicans Want to Abolish the Minimum Wage: Republicans in Congress want to get rid of the minimum wage altogether. Sen. Lamar Alexander recently told Sen. Sanders at a hearing that he does not believe in the concept of minimum wage, according to The Huffington Post.    The Kooky Koch Brothers: Sen. Sanders prodded Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attacks on Charles and David Koch, the billionaire industrialists who bankroll Republican causes and candidates. Sanders provided Reid a copy of the Libertarian Party platform from 1980, when David Koch was its vice presidential nominee. The platform called for dismantling Social Security, welfare, the Federal Reserve Board, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission, not to mention the Federal Election Commission and its campaign contribution limits. “The ideas that David Koch ran on in 1980 … were considered kooky, crazy ideas. Today … the ideas are now part of mainstream Republican thinking,” Sanders told Politico.   VA Nominee: The White House on Monday formally submitted to the Senate the nomination of Robert McDonald to head the Veterans Affairs Department. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders will meet Tuesday with McDonald to start the confirmation process, The Hill, Fox News and PJ Media reported.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Declaration of Independence: “While the very rich become richer, the poor become poorer and the middle class disappears … now is the time to alter our government. Now is the time to stop the movement toward oligarchy. Now is the time to create a government which represents all Americans, and not just the 1 percent,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column for The Huffington Post.   VA Reforms: Lawmakers involved in conference negotiations over Veterans Affairs reforms are still working to contain costs and have been consulting with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Republicans have raised questions about the legitimacy of estimates that the legislation could cost as much as $50 billion a year. No formal public meetings have been scheduled and the real negotiating is expected to take place largely behind the scenes. Meantime, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee is working to schedule a confirmation hearing for Robert McDonald, the former corporate executive who is Obama's pick to be the next VA secretary. Chairman Bernie Sanders expects to receive McDonald's formal nomination from the White House this week and hopes to meet with nominee to discuss how he would lead the department, National Journal reported.   High-Speed Internet: Lightning-fast Internet connectivity, telemedicine advances and even robot surrogates in classrooms are just a sampling of what state leaders and telecommunications companies like VTel hope will be coming to Vermont in the near future. VTel last Tuesday rolled out a statewide high-speed communications network in Hardwick that will serve sections of rural Vermont. Four years ago, Vermont ranked 35th in the nation in terms of broadband availability, according to David Weinstein, a representative of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sander’s office. After the projects are complete, officials hope the state will rank first, The Associated Press reported in an article published in Monday’s Times Argus and Rutland Herald.   Battle Over Export Bank Heats Up: Lawmakers at a recent House hearing on the future of the Export-Import Bank were given an extra piece of reading material: a personalized index card laying out exactly which companies in their districts benefit from the financing agency and how many people they employ. The cards, which supporters of the bank plan to give to every member of Congress in coming weeks, are part of a lobbying push by corporations such as Boeing and General Electric and business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Independence Day: Sen. Bernie Sanders, in an Independence Day message, urged Americans to remember the “profound vision embodied in the Declaration of Independence” and to “liberate yourself from the political dominance of the wealthy.” Sanders added: “Now is the time to alter our government. Now is the time to stop the movement toward oligarchy. Now is the time to create a government which represents all Americans, not just the 1 percent,” according to The Raw Story.  VA Reform: In Congress, a bipartisan House and Senate committee met to craft legislation to change the way the nation's largest integrated health care system does business. The goal is to get a bill to President Obama this month, but it has been delayed because of the bill's potential cost. Lawmakers are hoping to reconcile elements of a House-approved bill and Senate legislation, co-sponsored by Arizona Sen. John McCain and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders, The Arizona Republic reported.  NSA Surveillance: Ordinary Internet users, American and non-American alike, far outnumber legally targeted foreigners in communications intercepted by the National Security Agency from U.S. digital networks, according to The Washington Post. Nine of 10 account holders found in a large cache of intercepted conversations … were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in a net the agency had cast for somebody else. Many of them were Americans. The files revealed a secret overseas nuclear project, double-dealing by an ostensible ally, a military calamity that befell an unfriendly power, and the identities of aggressive intruders into U.S. computer networks.

The Declaration of Independence: A Revolutionary Document - By Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  As we celebrate this July 4th weekend, it's important that we not forget the profound vision embodied in the Declaration of Independence.  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness."  Today, while the very rich become richer, the poor become poorer and the middle class disappears, the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%, and 95% of all new income goes to the top 1%.  Today, in terms of life expectancy, poverty has become a death sentence. With better health care, education and nutrition, the top 1% has seen an increase in their longevity. They now live 12 years longer than the people at the bottom of the economic ladder, people who are actually seeing a decline in how long they live.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   American Heroes: To celebrate Independence Day, The Guardian put together a list of American heroes including Bayard Rustin, the lead organizer of the 1963 march on Washington; Cesar Chavez, the farmworker organizer and one of the most respected civil rights leaders of the 20th century; and Bernie Sanders, “the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history, and a healthy note of plurality in a heavily two-party system.”  VA Reform: Sen. Sanders is optimistic that a comprehensive VA health care reform package will win final approval in Congress in the near future. Sanders said the proposal is needed to ensure that all veterans receive critical medical services in a timely manner. As the chairman of the Senate’s Veterans Affairs committee, Sanders has played a key role in developing a plan to deal with a crisis facing the VA health care system, Vermont Public Radio reported.

The Week in Review:
 
 As the nation celebrated Independence Day on Friday, Americans driving to see fireworks displays or go on family vacations found that it costs more to fill their gas tanks. Pump prices were at a six-year high for July. In Washington on Monday, the Supreme Court recessed for the summer after handing down rulings in two major cases involving the rights of women and workers.  And on Thursday, the Labor Department’s monthly job report showed real unemployment in June remained in double digits.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Road Money Drying Up Vermont’s Agency of Transportation is preparing to delay 38 bridge, rail and road projects as the federal Highway Trust Fund is expected to become insolvent in early August. The U.S. Senate Finance Committee reportedly is working on a short-term financing plan to be unveiled next week when senators return from their July Fourth break, Sen. Sanders’ staff told the Burlington Free Press.  Birth Control Order Deepens Court Divide: In a decision that drew an unusually fierce dissent from the three female justices, the Supreme Court sided Thursday with religiously affiliated nonprofit groups in a clash between religious freedom and women’s rights. The decision temporarily exempts a Christian college in Illinois from part of the regulations that provide contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act, The New York Times reported. The court’s action “undermines confidence in this institution,” Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan dissented.  Single Women Reshape Electorate: The decline of marriage over the last generation has helped create an emerging voting bloc of unmarried women that is profoundly reshaping the American electorate to the advantage of the Democratic Party, The New York Times reported.   Social Security: Though the most popular age to sign up for Social Security is 62, starting benefits at this age results in significantly smaller monthly payments, according to a new government report cited by U.S. News & World Report.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Gas Prices Going Up: Ahead of a holiday weekend, gasoline prices are at a six-year high. Sen. Bernie Sanders blames excessive speculation in commodity markets. He introduced a bill that would require federal regulators to clamp down. “There is more supply today than there was five years ago, and less demand, so if you had a normal functioning market with supply and demand the price should go down,” Sanders told Ed Schultz during an interview Wednesday on MSNBC.  Global Warming: A new study by Regional Economics Modeling Inc. concluded that a revenue-neutral carbon fee collected on all fossil fuels would create more than 2 million jobs while reducing total emissions of greenhouse gasses that cause global warming. Sen. Sanders introduced a comprehensive climate change bill that uses a similar fee and dividend structure, Sandra O’Flaherty of Citizens Climate Lobby wrote in an op-ed for the Burlington Free Press.  Meals on Wheels: Representatives from Sen. Sanders’ office visited Bennington County Wednesday. One of their stops was the Bennington Café, which is part of the Meals on Wheels nutrition program for seniors. Executive Director Susan Fox said there has been a 25 percent increase in the number of meals served since last year — about 10,000 more — and the number of people being served has doubled, the Bennington Banner reported.  VA Reform: A conference committee will resume work next week to iron out differences between House and Senate bills to reform to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said the chances of an agreement are good because there are “more similarities than differences” between the House and Senate bills, according to Politico.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Gas Prices Up for 4th of July: Gas prices for the long Fourth of July holiday weekend are at their highest level since before the start of the recession. Speculation in commodities markets is one factor driving the increase, said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at GasBuddy.com, a website that tracks prices of the fuel in real time. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Rosa DeLauro introduced legislation that would require federal regulators to stop excessive speculation in oil futures markets, the New Haven (Connecticut) Register and other McClatchy newspapers reported. Sanders is part of a growing and diverse coalition of market watchers who believe speculators are partly responsible for rising oil and gas prices, National Journal reported.  Union Workers: The Supreme Court on Monday dealt a significant blow to organized labor in a 5-4 ruling that personal home-care employees in Illinois cannot be forced to pay union fees, Mint Press News reported. “Make no mistake: this decision will lead to an increase in income inequality, a further decline in the wages of middle-class workers and an increase in poverty,” said Sen. Sanders.     Hobby Lobby: Americans from across the political spectrum used social media to weigh in on another Supreme Court ruling on Monday that business owners’ religious views trump workers’ rights to coverage for family planning services under the Affordable Care Act. “Bosses should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on their employees,” Sen. Sanders said on Twitter, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Sun-Sentinel reported.   VA Nominee: A onetime Army Ranger and former CEO of a Fortune 500 company, Robert McDonald may face his toughest challenge yet in fixing the huge, scandal-plagued Veterans Affairs Department. Veterans groups worry that the longtime corporate executive may have trouble adjusting to a far-flung bureaucracy of more than 300,000 employees. Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, said he was reserving judgment until he hears firsthand McDonald's plans to fix the VA, The Associated Press reported.

An Attack on Workers:  The Supreme Court ruled against a union that had collected fees from workers who were not members but nevertheless benefited from better pay and working conditions that the union negotiated. The case decided on Monday involved home-care workers in Illinois whose hourly wages rose from $7 in 2003 to $13 in 2014. The workers also received health insurance paid for by the state and other benefits. The state and taxpayers benefited by paying less for home care than it would have cost to put people in expensive institutional care.  Sen. Bernie Sanders called the court decision “another attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain for higher wages and decent benefits.” The decision by Justice Samuel Alito Jr., and four other extreme right-wing Republicans “is another attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain for higher wages and decent benefits.” It could have been worse, Sanders noted. The ruling did not go as far as some worker advocates had feared so other public-sector employees may still have an effective voice at the bargaining table.  Supreme Court analyst Jeffrey Toobin warned that it still could get worse. Writing for The New Yorker, Toobin said the conservative court has a pattern of first deciding a case in a “narrow” way but then using a decision as a precedent to move the law in a more dramatic, conservative direction in a subsequent case.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Court Rules Against Women: “Bosses should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on their employees,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on WPTZ-TV after the Supreme Court ruled Monday that two Christian-owned companies do not have to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. “There is no valid reason to restrict a woman's access to safe, widely-used preventive services simply because her employer does not approve,” Sanders said on WVNY-TV. Sanders, who joined a group of senators in filing a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, called the ruling “another attack on the rights of working people by the 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court,” the Times Argus and Rutland Herald reported.  Court Rules Against Unions: The Supreme Court dealt a blow to organized labor on Monday by ruling that some government employees did not have to pay any fees to the unions representing them. Sen. Sanders, a longtime backer of organized labor, criticized the decision, the Burlington Free Press reported. He condemned the ruling as “another attack on the rights of workers to collectively bargain for higher wages and decent benefits,” the Christian Science Monitor and VTDigger.com reported.  Obama Nominates VA Secretary: President Barack Obama on Monday nominated Robert McDonald, the former chairman of Procter & Gamble, as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said he looks forward to meeting McDonald next week, Air Force Times, Fox News, and VT Digger reported.   Senate Veterans Chairman Surprised by Pick: Sen. Sanders told The New York Times that he was surprised by the pick, which he said was made “I presume because of his management skills.” Those are important, Sanders added, but more critical will be McDonald’s approach to fixing the VA, which Sanders said needs more accountability and transparency — and more doctors.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   President Obama Taps Ex P&G Exec to Lead VA: President Barack Obama plans to nominate former Proctor & Gamble executive Robert McDonald as the next Veterans Affairs secretary. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said he looks forward to meeting with McDonald to get his views on important issues which, Sanders said, include increased funding for the VA to hire more doctors, nurses and other medical staff, The Associated Press reported.   Chairman Sanders is ‘Neutral’ and ‘Cautious’: Sen. Sanders “offered a neutral reaction to Mr. Obama’s choice,” The New York Times reported. He “struck a neutral tone,” The Wall Street Journal said. Sanders “delivered a cautious statement on the news,” according to The Washington Post. A Fox News Radio reporter interpreted what Sanders’ statement means for McDonald’s confirmation prospects: “That doesn’t say it’s going to be a slam dunk.” Sanders plans to meet McDonald next week, the Los Angeles Times reported. Sanders said he is looking forward to learning more of McDonald's views on the needs of the agency, USA Today, The Washington Times, CNN and Politico reported.   VA Needs More Doctors, Sanders Says: “Bernie Sanders of Vermont said we need more doctors and we need more resources at the VA,” John Harwood said on CNBC. Sanders said VA needs greater transparency and accountability and more doctors, nurses and other medical staff so all veterans who are eligible get high-quality health care in a timely manner, Fox News and WTOP-AM news radio in Washington, D.C., reported.   Court Rulings Due on Unions, Health Care: On the last day of this year’s term, The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in a case challenging the ability of public-sector unions to collect fees from workers who decline to join. Also on tap is a ruling in another case involving the Affordable Care Act—this time on whether the religious beliefs of owners of for-profit enterprises give them the right to opt out of the law's requirement of contraception coverage for employees, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Veterans Affairs:   President Barack Obama on Monday will nominate Robert McDonald, a former Procter & Gamble executive and West Point graduate, to be secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the White House indicated on Sunday. “The VA needs significantly improved transparency and accountability and it needs an increased number of doctors, nurses and other medical staff so that all eligible veterans get high-quality health care in a timely manner. I look forward to meeting with Mr. McDonald next week in order to ascertain his views on these important issues,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders. He chairs the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.

Obama Seeks Emergency Funds on Immigration: The Obama administration, in a dramatic escalation of its border control strategy, will seek $2 billion in emergency funds to help stem an influx of Central American women and children entering the country illegally and new measures to more quickly deport those already here, The Washington Post reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   VA Scorched for 'Chronic' Failures’: A review ordered by President Barack Obama of the troubled Veterans Affairs health care system concludes that medical care for veterans is beset by "significant and chronic system failures." Sen. Bernie Sanders, who heads the Senate's Veterans' Affairs Committee, said the VA must restructure decision-making between its headquarters and its regional offices, The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times , The Washington Post online, MSNBC and Politico reported.   Gas Price Hikes: In a bid to lower gas prices, Sen. Sen. Sanders has introduced legislation to require federal market regulators to take emergency action to curb excessive speculation in energy markets. The bill would make the Commodity Futures Trading Commission stop speculators from "taking advantage of turmoil in Iraq" to spike gas prices, Congressional Quarterly, The Hill andNational Journal reported.    Income Inequality: Sen. Sanders brought together Vermont religious leaders to discuss income and wealth inequality in the United States. The senator offered statistics to back up his view that inequality is way out of hand in the country, greater than any time since the 1920s, greater than any other major country on earth, with more Americans in poverty than ever, according to theBennington Banner.

The Week in Review   Are Republicans listening to warnings from scientists about global warming? While many in Congress write off climate change as a hoax, it turns out some leading Republican figures are beginning to take the problem seriously. Big Oil and Wall Street speculators used turmoil in Iraq as a bogus excuse to raise oil and gas prices. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday introduced legislation to stop runaway speculation.  A Senate and House conference committee met Tuesday to try to thrash out differences in legislation to reform health care services for veterans.  Sanders chairs the Senate veterans committee. As Congress broke for a Fourth of July recess, however, he voiced frustration with members of Congress who are willing to send troops into war but balk at paying for the health care that was promised to those who fought our wars. He spoke about that and other issues on Friday during his weekly radio and Internet appearance on The Thom Hartmann Program.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Gas Prices: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday introduced legislation to make federal regulators invoke emergency powers to stop speculators from taking advantage of turmoil in Iraq to drive up oil prices and make motorists pay more for gasoline, the Burlington Free Press and Los Angeles Times reported. “I am getting tired of big oil companies and Wall Street speculators using Iraq as an excuse to pump up oil and gas prices,” Sanders said.   VA Reform: Sen. Sanders, who is chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and Sen. John McCain led the push for Senate passage of VA reform measure that would let veterans visit civilian doctors in certain circumstances. But Sanders worries that allowing visits to physicians outside the system will lead to the privatization of veterans care. He told The Associated Press that the real problem is a 16 percent increase in patients cared for by the VA from 2008 to 2013.  U.S. Media Gives Platform to Iraq War Hawks: The architects of the Iraq war are back in TV studios and on op-ed pages, as are journalists and pundits who promoted the Bush administration’s ultimately bogus case for invading. Despite catastrophic misjudgments -- that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that U.S. forces would be greeted as liberators, that the war would pay for itself with oil revenues -- the Iraq war boosters keep getting booked, while those politicians and journalists who were skeptical of the Bush administration's “slam dunk” case for war remain largely on the sidelines, The Huffington Post reported.

Speculators Exploit Iraq to Spike Oil and Gas Prices: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/speculators-exploit-iraq-to-spike-oil-and-gas-prices
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Shakeup: Two top Department of Veterans Affairs officials are stepping down, the beleaguered agency announced Wednesday as it continued reeling from complaints that thousands of veterans have endured long waits for appointments and poor medical care. Will Gunn is resigning as general counsel and Dr. Robert Jesse, who has been acting undersecretary for health, is leaving that post. Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson made the moves less than a month after he replaced Eric Shinseki as head of the agency. “What Gibson is trying to do is bring people in who he thinks will be as responsive as possible,” Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders told The Associated Press.   VA Reform: Congressional leaders met this week to discuss the differences between House and Senate proposals aimed at reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs in hopes of hammering out a single bill that can be signed into law quickly. Sen. Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller, chairmen of the Senate and House veterans affairs committees, led the first conference between the two committees in 15 years, the Times Argus. Both Miller and Sanders said they’re still confident they can get a bill finished quickly, Military Times reported.   VA Health Care: Sen. Sanders “deserves great credit for his hard work in crafting legislation addressing the severe delays experienced by veterans seeking needed health care services at Veterans Affairs hospitals. One of the models of reform is of course the senator’s home state of Vermont. Here, nurse practitioners have been providing care to patients since the 1970’s. And since 2011, Vermont’s nurse practitioners have provided full and direct patient care unencumbered by costly and redundant government regulations,” Deborah Wachtel of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners wrote in a column published in Thursday’s Burlington Free Press.   Corporate Welfare: Legislation to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank elicits support today from congressional Democrats and the Chamber of Commerce and opposition from Sen. Sanders and Tea Party Republicans who call the bank a form of “corporate welfare,” Salon reported. In a 2002 speech, Sanders lambasted the bank, asking why American taxpayers would provide “huge subsidies and loans to the largest multinational corporations in the world… which take this money from the taxpayers and say... we are laying you off because we are going to China and hiring somebody at 20 cents an hour.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/062614
War on Jobs: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/war-on-jobs
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Reform: House and Senate negotiators opened talks Tuesday on legislation to expand health care for veterans and reform the Department of Veterans Affairs. "The simple truth of the matter is that the VA needs more doctors, more nurses, more mental health providers, and, in certain parts of the country, more space for a growing patient population," said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who chairs the Senate veterans committee, The Associated Press and Bloomberg reported. Sen. John McCain, who developed the Senate bill along with Sanders, told Roll Call before the meeting, “I don’t think it’s going to be easy, but we can get something done.”   The Cost of War: House and Senate conferees wrapped up their first session Tuesday without a clear picture of how to handle the bill’s hefty price tag. Chairman Sanders is sticking to his contention that the expenditures would address an emergency and therefore require no budget offsets.  “If it is not an emergency to have tens of thousands of veterans not getting the health care they need in a timely manner, then I’m not quite sure what an emergency is,” he said, according to Congressional Quarterly, The Washington Times. “The cost of war does not end when the last shots are fired and the last missiles are launched,” Sanders said on WCAX-TV.  Gas Prices: Sen. Sanders said that speculators are using the Iraq crisis as an excuse to artificially drive up oil and gasoline prices. "I am getting tired of big oil companies telling us that gasoline prices are going up because of the turmoil in Iraq," Sanders said. "The truth is that big oil will never miss an opportunity to increase the price of gas. The fact is that high gasoline prices have less to do with supply and demand and more to do with Wall Street speculators driving prices up," he added in a report by The Seattle Times.   The Bank of Boeing: Incoming House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s opposition to the Export-Import bank has reignited a debate over its reauthorization. The fight has paired the White House, the Chamber of Commerce, House Democrats, and business lobbyists against Tea Partiers, Sen. Sanders and the Koch brothers, according to MSNBC.com. The Washington Post said the reauthorization debate could result in another government shutdown if Senate Democratic leaders push to include the measure in an appropriations bill.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Working Families: President Barack Obama on Monday called for paid parental leave and other family-friendly policies during the first White House Summit on Working Families. Three Vermont advocates for fair workplace practices – state Rep. Tom Stevens of Waterbury, Cary Brown of the Vermont Commission on Women and Lindsay DesLauriers of the Main Street Alliance – made up the state’s delegation to the conference. The summit focused on bills addressing workplace issues like ones by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and make employers accommodate pregnant workers, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported.   VA Whistleblowers: An independent investigator found that the VA ignored problems cited by whistleblowers, including unsanitary medical instruments and psychiatric patients who went for years without evaluations. “Legitimate concerns must not be covered up or papered over by administrators," Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said, according to USA Today and The Associated Press. In The Washington Post, Sanders expressed his hope that a conference committee which meets today will iron out differences in Senate- and the House-passed legislation to “significantly improve the quality and timeliness of care.”  VA Reform: A House and Senate conference committee meets today to resolve differences between separate approaches to VA reform legislation. Sen. Sanders said his “goal is to get this legislation onto the president’s desk as soon as we possibly can.” Sanders will co-chair the conference with Rep. Jeff Miller, who launched an aggressive schedule of hearings and investigations into wrongdoings at the VA, according to The Washington Post.   Global Warming: More than a million homes and businesses along the nation’s coasts could flood before ultimately being destroyed. Entire states in the Southeast and the Corn Belt may lose farms as agriculture production shifts northward, according to a report by a bipartisan coalition that includes Republicans George P. Shultz, who served under President Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan and Henry M. Paulson Jr., who served under President George W. Bush. Robert E. Rubin, a Democrat in the Clinton administration, also is part of the group that endorsed putting a price on greenhouse gases, most likely by taxing emissions, The New York Times reported.

A ‘Major Breakthrough’ on Global Warming?  “This is a crisis we can’t afford to ignore,” warned Henry Paulson. The former treasury secretary’s op-ed was published Sunday in The New York Times. Days earlier, four former EPA administrators –  William Ruckelshaus, Lee Thomas, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman – testified at a Senate hearing on climate change.  What’s remarkable about that roster is that everyone on it – Paulson, Ruckelshaus, Thomas , Reilly and Whitman – are all Republicans. They served in four different presidents – Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush –  all Republicans.

Bernie Sanders, met Thursday and conference committee staff were scheduled to meet Friday, but the conferees themselves are not due to meet for the first time until Tuesday, National Journal reported.   Income Inequality: Sen. Sanders on Friday held a news conference with Vermont religious leaders to discuss the moral implications of extreme wealth and income inequality. Bishop Thomas Ely, Rabbi Joshua Chasan, the Rev. Dr. Lynn Bujnak, and Monsignor Roland Rivard were present, as well as several other Episcopal clergy and faith leaders, the Episcopal News Service reported.   Kerry in Baghdad: Confronting the threat of civil war in Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Baghdad on Monday to personally urge the Shiite-led government to give more power to political opponents before a Sunni insurgency seizes more control across the country. CBS News reported that in a nearly two-hour long meeting, Kerry urged Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other Iraqi leaders to form an inclusive coalition government with grassroots support.   The Democrats’ Koch Brothers: The Democracy Alliance intends to spend $374 million during the midterm election cycle — including nearly $200 million this year — to boost liberal candidates and causes in 2014 and beyond, according to Politico. While growing sums of that cash are being spent vilifying the billionaire conservative industrialists Charles and David Koch over their own network’s political spending, the documents reveal the extent to which the Democracy Alliance network mirrors the Kochs’ – and is obsessed with it.

Bernie Sanders created a selection panel, Crawford was one of two names that rose to the surface, the Burlington Free Press reported.  Corporate America Concerned about Climate Change: “Climate change is the challenge of our time. Each of us must recognize that the risks are personal.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Income Inequality: Vermont religious leaders joined Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday in saying that vast income disparity in the United States is a moral issue, not just an economic problem. “There is something profoundly wrong when the economic system of today creates a situation where some people have more wealth than you can imagine,” Sanders said. “I personally do not know – I really don’t – what people do with $80 billion.” Sanders said that in recent years 95-percent of all new income has gone to the top 1 percent, the Burlington Free Press, WPTZ-TV, WCAX-TV, VTDigger.com, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.   Warren Echoes Sanders on Class Divide: Vermont Democrats gathered Friday evening for the state party’s largest annual fundraiser, where Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren decried the Republican Party for favoring the rich over low- and middle-income Americans. “Warren delivered a message to Vermonters similar to one that the state’s own independent Sen. Sanders has been saying for years,” the Times Argus reported.   War in Iraq: Sen. Sanders on Friday told reporters he thinks it's a good idea to defend the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and to send military advisors there, but the independent wants our role to be limited. “I do not want and will vigorously oppose American ground troops in Iraq," he told WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV. He said the United States should work with other countries in the region. “It is not just an American issue. It is an international issue,” Sanders told WPTZ-TV. “We should never have gone into Iraq.

Speculators Use Iraq to Drive Up Oil and Gas Prices:  Sen. Bernie Sanders accused oil companies and Wall Street speculators of using unrest in Iraq as a phony excuse to artificially drive up crude oil and gasoline prices.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The Great Recession: Employers hired 217,000 workers in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, enough to finally lift total payrolls above where they were before the financial collapse nearly six years ago. “The American people don’t feel it,” Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Worker-Owned Businesses: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced legislation to provide federal assistance to workers who want to form their own businesses and owners who want to sell businesses to their employees, the Burlington Free Press, The Associated Press, WCAX-TV and WVNY-TV reported. Employees invested directly in a business’ success are “a part of the system; they’re not just a cog in the machine,” the senator said at a news conference at his Burlington office.  Global Warming: Sen. Sanders welcomed new rules proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency to curb greenhouse gas emissions at coal-based power plants, but said "much more must be done to avoid a planetary crisis," The Wall Street Journal, WCAX-TV, WPTZ-TV and AP reported. The new rules require a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. Vermont is the only state not covered under the EPA rule proposed Monday because there are no in-state fossil fuel-fired power plants.   VA Reform: Senate Democrats are rallying around a comprehensive proposal by Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders that would give the VA secretary authority to remove senior officials based on poor job performance, grant the department expedited hiring authority for nurses and doctors and make other changes. The committee will hold a hearing on Sanders’ measure Thursday. In an interview with The Washington Post, Sanders said he supports making it easier to punish poor-performing managers but wants to ensure that it would not lead to the politicization of the department.   VA Reform: Sen. Sanders’ bill would address widespread problems with the Veterans Affairs health care system, AP, MSNBC, Fox News, CBS News, National Public Radio, WCAX-TV, Vermont Public Radio and Federal Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Taliban Releases U.S. Soldier in Afghansitan: U.S. officials welcomed the return of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the only American soldier held prisoner in Afghanistan, but voiced concern about the release of five members of the Taliban who had been held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of a negotiated prisoner swap. In an interview on CBS News, Sen. Bernie Sanders called the prisoner exchange a "sensitive and delicate issue" and said there needs to be more information about the long-term consequences of the release and steps to ensure the detainees do not return to the battlefield.   Sanders Outlines New VA Bill: Appearing Sunday on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said he will introduce a far-reaching proposal to overhaul health care for the nation's veterans that would make it easier for the beleaguered Department of Veterans Affairs to hire and fire employees, lease new space for clinics and hospitals, send veterans to outside providers if they face long delays and authorize ways to hire and to attract new doctors and nurses to the VA, The Washington Post and The Associated Press reported.  White House Commission on Veterans Suggested: Chairman Sanders’ sweeping legislation in the Senate also would update antiquated VA computer systems, expand coverage for veterans and push President Barack Obama to create a commission to examine VA health care, The Wall Street Journal reported.  Sanders at Center Stage: Sanders has become a” central player on a crucial issue dominating the national debate. He’s been on the phone with President Obama and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough about how to move legislation forward in this tricky political climate. “We’re going to take a lot of guidance from him on how to improve the system,” Sen. Charles Schumer told Politico.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/060214

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Shakeup: The resignation on Friday of Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki left lawmakers debating the best fix for the country’s largest health care network. Some veterans called Shinseki’s resignation a step in the right direction, while others felt the retired Army general had been forced out unfairly. Sen. Sanders called Shinseki “an American hero” and said he was saddened by his resignation, The Valley News reported on Sunday. LINK  Treatment of Veterans: “You’ve served your country with honor. Now, let VA serve you,” the Department of Veterans Affairs website proclaims. “The time is long past for the department … to honor that promise,” the Burlington Free Press said in a Sunday editorial. “Wars take their toll, as the saying goes, in blood and treasure. The bills keep coming long after the fighting has ceased. Sen. Bernie Sanders nailed the bottom line when he said on the floor of the Senate, ‘If you think it’s too expensive to take care of veterans, then don’t send them to war.’” LINK  Sunday TV: The scandal surrounding Veterans Affairs hospitals — leading to Friday’s resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki — dominates the lineup on Sunday talk shows. CBS' “Face the Nation” will interview Veterans' Committee Chairman Sanders and Sen. John McCain, a frequent critic of the VA, as well as VFW Executive Director Robert E. Wallace. “Fox News Sunday” has Rep. Jeff Miller, the House veterans' committee chairman. NBC's “Meet the Press features Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, USA Today reported. LINK  Senate Republicans Voted Against Veterans: Senate Republicans last winter derailed a bill by Sen. Sanders that would have expanded health care, job-training, education and other benefits for veterans. Only two Republican Senators voted for Sanders’ bill, Melissa Harris-Perry said during her Saturday program on MSNBC.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/0601142
Mr. Shinseki Takes the Fall - The New York Times:   The resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki from the Veterans Affairs Department was probably unavoidable, under the principle that a leader should accept full responsibility for a great scandal. But the department’s problem was not Mr. Shinseki. It has been broken for years. No one should expect his removal to be anything but the beginning of a much-needed process of change.  Time now to tune out the noise from the lawmakers who lately have been baying for Mr. Shinseki’s head. No doubt they will keep heaping abuse on President Obama, on the campaign trail, and at the hearings for whoever is nominated as Mr. Shinseki’s replacement. Empty posturing in support of troops and veterans is a staple of political life, and is far easier than actually helping veterans.  This should not distract anyone from the long list of things that need doing at Veterans Affairs.  It starts with completing the investigation into what happened at the hospital in Phoenix and, evidently, many other parts of the department’s sprawling health care system. Veterans Affairs’ acting inspector general, Richard Griffin, is on the job: a preliminary report he released on Wednesday showed evidence of wide-scale mismanagement, not just in shutting out 1,700 veterans in Phoenix through fraudulent appointment records but in the “systemic” use of “inappropriate scheduling practices” at hospitals across the country. Policies that rewarded the appearance of efficiency, and thus encouraged fraud, need to be repaired, wrongdoers need to be prosecuted, and veterans who have languished must be fast-tracked into care.

VIDEO: Sen. Sanders talks with Chris Hayes about Secretary Shinseki and fixing the VA medical system: http://youtu.be/1jxXu19Wi9g
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Chief Resigns: Eric Shinseki resigned as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs on Friday. A shortage of doctors and lack of resources was a major cause of problems at VA hospitals and clinics. “There are parts of the country where we simply do not have the number of doctors and nurses we need,” Sen. Bernard Sanders, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, told The New York Times. The Justice Department should pursue criminal prosecution of those found to have manipulated waitlists to see VA doctors, Sanders told CNN.   Sanders Saddened: Sen. Sanders was saddened by Shinseki’s resignation, WCAX-TV reported. He called Shinseki a “true American hero” during interviews on MSNBC, CNN and The Thom Hartmann Program.  What Now?: Senate Democrats plan to move their version of a House-passed bill giving the VA secretary greater authority to fire high-level employees. Sen. Sanders also plans to revive a broader veterans' benefits package that would allow the VA to open 27 new medical facilities around the country and provide incentives to lure more doctors and nurses into VA careers, The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press reported. Shinseki urged Congress to support Sanders’ legislation, CBS News, Fox News, The Guardian, Politico, National Journal and Washington Examiner reported.  Republicans Roadblocks: President Obama and many Democratic lawmakers say an increase in veterans using VA hospitals calls for more doctors and nurses to prevent veterans from having to endure long wait times for care. But hiring them would require a big funding increase, something that is unlikely to happen given the strong resistance by Republicans. In February, Senate Republicans blocked a bill by Sen. Sanders to expand veterans' benefits. Just two Republican senators voted for the measure that would have cost about $21 billion over a decade, Reuters reported.

The Week in Review:   Eric Shinseki resigned Friday as the Department of Veterans Affairs chief. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the retired four-star general “an American hero.” He also pledged to work with new leadership at the VA to transform the culture and punish those responsible for manipulating records to conceal how long it really takes to see a doctor. New calls to abolish door-to-door mail service are part of a “fierce attack on the Postal Service,” Sanders said on Wednesday. A new report prepared for Sanders looked at when and why people enroll for Social Security retirement benefits. And the industry-friendly Nuclear Regulatory Commission turned down calls by Sanders and others to improve the safety of spent radioactive fuel rods. The senators plan legislation to make the NRC do the right thing.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-053014
An American Hero: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/an-american-hero
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Doc Shortage Cited in VA Delays: An acute shortage of primary care doctors is behind delays at some hospitals and clinics run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. “The problem facing the VA in terms of not having the number of primary care doctors and nurses it needs is part of a national crisis,” Sen. Bernard Sanders, the Senate veterans committee chairman, told The New York Times. He will offer legislation to let VA patients who can’t get appointments go to community health centers, military hospitals or private doctors. He also wants to provide medical school scholarships and loan forgiveness as incentives to attract more physicians and nurses to careers at the VA.   VA Health Centers: Veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are overwhelming underfunded VA facilities in the Southwest and South, Sen. Sanders told The New York Times. VA has set a goal of seeing patients within 14 days. “Do we have the staffing to achieve that goal?” Sanders asked. “In some parts of the country, clearly we do not.” As part of the solution, Sanders’ bill also would fund construction of 27 new VA health facilities, The Hill reported.   Vermont Yankee: A decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this week not to endorse the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from pools to dry cask storage won’t have an effect on the anticipated transfer of the highly radioactive fuel at Vermont Yankee. Vermont Department of Public Service Commissioner Christopher Recchia said Entergy Nuclear already committed to move Yankee’s 3,000 spent fuel rods into casks. The decision by the NRC was protested by Sen. Sand‍‍ers, who this month introduced legislation to require the removal of spent fuel to dry casks, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported.   Save Social Security: Sanders has advocated for years that the fairest approach to making Social Security fully solvent for the next 50 years is to lift the cap on taxable income, and apply the Social Security payroll tax on income above $250,000. “We’re inclined to agree with Sanders,” the Brattleboro Reformer said in an editorial on Friday.

Perspective:  Sen. Bernie Sanders called it “unacceptable” that some veterans are forced to wait too long for care at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. And he said it was “totally intolerable” that some VA employees may be manipulating records to hide how long veterans really have to wait to see doctors. But he also offered some perspective on the situation as chairman of both the Senate veterans committee and a subcommittee on primary care. He has warned for years that the nation’s entire health care system is facing a crisis in primary care. Merritt Hawkins, a health care consulting firm, found this year that the average wait time to see a family physician in 15 markets studied was 19.5 days. That’s longer than the VA’s goal of 14 days. Sanders is the chief sponsor of legislation that the Senate debated in in February that would have expanded the department’s health system with 27 new facilities.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders:   Postal Service: Republicans are moving to end door-to-door mail delivery at the U.S. Postal Service instead of eliminating a burdensome mandate that requires the agency to prefund retiree benefits for decades. Sen. Sanders told The Ed Show on MSNBC the Postal Service would “make about a billion dollars in profit” this year without the prefunding mandate. “If you want to save the Postal Service, you get rid of that burden, not prevent people from getting door-to-door delivery,” Sanders said.   VA Health Care: The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general said veterans using a Phoenix VA hospital were inappropriately kept on unofficial waiting lists. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who leads the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, called the inspector general's interim findings "unacceptable" but didn't join in calls for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to step down. He urged Shinseki to immediately implement the inspector general’s recommendations, The Washington Post and New York Daily News reported.   Nuclear Safety: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected calls from U.S. senators and watchdog groups to move spent nuclear fuel from storage pools into safer, sturdier dry casks, the Cape Cod Times reported.  The commission's vote prompted a response from Sens. Sanders, Barbara Boxer and Ed Markey, who have proposed legislation that would give plant owners 180 days to put together plans for moving spent fuel rods from wet pools to dry casks, according to an Associated Press report in the Brattleboro Reformer.   President to Act on Carbon Pollution: President Obama will use his executive authority to cut carbon emissions from the nation’s coal-fired power plants by up to 20 percent, according to people familiar with his plans, and will force industry to pay for the pollution it creates through cap-and-trade programs across the country. Obama will unveil his plans in a new regulation, written by the Environmental Protection Agency, at the White House on Monday, according to The New York Times.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Nuclear Safety: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected calls from U.S. senators and watchdog groups to move spent nuclear fuel from storage pools into safer, sturdier dry casks.  “We are one natural disaster, mechanical failure or terrorist attack away from a disaster,” Sen. Sanders told The Associated Press in a story published Tuesday by the Burlington Free Press, Valley News and Bennington Banner.   Sanders Praises Veterans: The nation's major veterans’ organizations have a good record representing their members in Washington, Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Tuesday. Sanders’ statement was a “stark contrast to the recent withering accusations by Sen. Richard Burr,” according to Politico. Sanders said he supports an independent budget drafted by veterans groups that would increase funding for vital VA programs, The Huffington Post reported.   The Cost of War: The nation’s major veterans’ organizations backed comprehensive legislation to improve health care, education, employment, and other benefits, but the Senate Republicans last winter blocked the bill citing its $21-billion, 10-year price tag. “It's just hypocritical to be talking about the cost of this legislation when they don't understand the real cost of war and what it means to the people who fight in those wars,” Sen. Sanders, the measure’s sponsor, told the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC.   VA Cost-Cutting: The Department of Veterans Affairs has consistently underestimated its funding needs to take care of the nation's millions of veterans, according to Sen. Patty Murray, the budget committee chairman and former veterans committee leader. Sen. Sanders has voiced similar concerns, Yahoo News reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans in War of Words with Burr: Leery that veterans may be pushed into an inferior private health care system, veterans groups engaged in a brutal war of words over the Memorial Day weekend with Sen. Richard Burr, the ranking Republican on the Senate Veterans Affairs’ Committee. Relations between veterans and Senate Republicans have been strained since Republicans blocked a vote on broad veterans legislation by Sen. Bernard Sanders, the committee chairman, that would have bolstered health and dental care, authorized 27 new clinics and improved veterans education programs, The New York Times reported.  VA Health Care: Sen. Sanders will introduce legislation after the Memorial Day break that will improve accountability at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, according to an Associated Press report published on Tuesday in The (Nashua, New Hampshire) Telegraph and the Times Argus. In many cases under current law, such officials can only be dismissed for misconduct. But Sanders said that unlike the House version passed on Wednesday, his bill would keep some due-process protections for VA managers and would prohibit politically motivated firings, Reuters reported on Tuesday.   VA Health Care: First it was Social Security, then Medicare and Medicaid, then the public health care option under Obamacare. Now, Republicans are calling for the privatization of the Veterans Health Administration, which provides cost-effective and high quality care to 6.2 million veterans. It is of course unacceptable if patients suffered as a result of any delays. And as Sen. Sanders said, "It's imperative that we uncover the problems that exist and address them boldly." But regardless of what went wrong at any VA facility, turning veterans over to private sector insurers and for-profit hospitals is not the solution, Suzanne Gordon wrote in a column for The Boston Globe.  Memorial Day: Sen. Sanders will introduce legislation to address performance problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs after the Senate’s Memorial Day recess. "We want to make sure that the administrators are accountable," Sanders told reporters after the Memorial Day parade in Vergennes, Vermont, in which he marched. "We want to make sure that nobody is fudging the books or running two sets of books in terms of access to VA health care,” he told WPTZ-TV, WVNY-TV, WFFF-TV and New England Cable News.

Memorial Day:  On this Memorial Day, Sen. Bernie Sanders thanked  all veterans who have put their lives on the line to defend our country and especially the families of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. "Congress must reaffirm its commitment to make sure that every veteran in this country and their families get the health care and other benefits that they have earned and deserve." added Sanders, chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.  "During the past several years, we have made significant progress. We have expanded education and employment opportunities, reduced homelessness, improved the processing of claims for disability benefits and given new support for the caregivers of disabled veterans. In the coming year, I look forward to working with veterans all across the country and their representatives here in Washington as we redouble our commitment to the men and women who have given so much for our nation,” the chairman said.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/chairman-sanders-statement-on-memorial-day
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Memorial Day: Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Memorial Day message to all veterans was read Monday on C-SPAN’s “Washington Journal.” Congress must make certain that veterans and their families get the care that they have earned and deserve, Sanders said in the statement. The program also aired an excerpt from a C-SPAN interview, first broadcast on Sunday, in which Sanders told veterans, “We will not forget the sacrifices that you’ve made.”  VA Health Care: Also on C-SPAN on Monday, American Legion Commander David Dellinger said Sen. Sanders was “spot on” about issues confronting the Department of Veterans Affairs. The comment came after Dellinger watched the Sunday interview in which Sanders said the VA must look into why there are waiting lists for care, whether the VA has sufficient resources, whether those resources are being allocated efficiently and whether the VA secretary has adequate authority to fire incompetent employees. “He knows what’s transpiring in today’s VA,” the Legion commander said on “Washington Journal.” Later in the program, Dellinger said Sanders and Rep. Jeff Miller, his House counterpart, are “adamant about getting information from the VA so they can look into … how the VA is running.”  VA Health Care: Sen. Sanders said he'll introduce legislation after the Memorial Day break that will improve accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs, The Associated Press reported on Sunday. Sanders also said he'll reintroduce broader legislation - which Senate Republicans blocked last winter - to improve veterans' health care, education, job-training and other benefits. During debate on Thursday, Sen. Marco Rubio complained about the $21 billion, 10-year cost of the comprehensive bill. "If you think it's too expensive to take care of our veterans then don't send them to warm" Sanders replied according to the article published by the Burlington Free Press reported.  A Bitter War of Words: Late Friday afternoon before the Memorial Day weekend, Sen. Richard Burr penned an open letter to America’s Veterans in which he took several veterans service groups to task for being insufficiently critical of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. The Veterans of Foreign Wars responded to Burr by calling his letter a “monumental cheap-shot” and labeling it “one of the most dishonorable and grossly inappropriate acts that we’ve witnessed in more than forty years of involvement with the veteran community,” according to The Huffington Post.

I do not want to see an enormous amount of paperwork … before we can get rid of incompetent people,” Sanders said Saturday on the CBS Morning News.   Media Matters: While mainstream media coverage of allegations of improper practices at certain Department of Veterans Affairs health clinics has been extensive in recent weeks, the bill by Sen. Sanders to expand health care for veterans that was blocked by Senate Republicans in February received little attention, according to an analysis by the news watchdog Media Matters. It said that broadcast network evening news shows completely ignored Republicans blocking the veterans health legislation.   VA Management: Unlike a House version passed on Wednesday, Sen.

Although the number of veterans seeking care has been increasing rapidly due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the VA, under Secretary Eric Shinseki, has cut it claims backlog almost in half.    VA Personnel: Senate Democrats plan legislation to make it easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to fire or demote senior executives. Sen. Sanders supports expanding VA firing powers but remains concerned that a future president could abuse that power to install political appointees at the VA, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Sanders told Chris Hayes Wednesday on MSNBC that 13 years of war have strained the veterans health care system and that more resources may need to be allocated in some areas to provide adequate care for returning soldiers. "Two million new veterans have come into the system," Sanders said. "I have no doubt that there are parts of the country where we simply do not have the staff needed to accommodate these veterans in a timely and effective way."    VA Health Care: “Everybody understands that when you treat 230,000 people a day, mistakes are going to be made, and that is true of any institution of that size,” Sanders said. But he also noted in Thursday’s New York Times that the agency’s inspector general and the Government Accountability Office have reported “on numerous occasions about problems having to do with scheduling and with waiting lists.”   Expand Medicaid for Veterans: More than 250,000 veterans would gain access to health care if Republican governors would expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. "Our job must be to improve quality health care, in my view for all people as a right, and certainly in the VA," Sen. Sanders told Alex Wagner on MSNBC. "As the president indicated, there's a sacred responsibility."   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/052114

Grassroots Movements: http://youtu.be/ObDn4NOR1fA
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The Grassroots: Unwilling to wait for Congress to act, local communities are taking action on issues ranging from minimum wages to climate change. “These movements all over America are standing up for justice,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an interview Tuesday during “The Ed Schultz Show” on MSNBC. “These protests and these actions by local city governments are enormously important.”   Net Neutrality: In a Senate floor speech Tuesday, Sen. Sanders said a Federal Communications Commission plan could mean "the end of the Internet as we know it."  Sanders said President Barack Obama should publicly denounce FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s proposal, The Hill reported.    Surveillance State: Progressives have been too reluctant to challenge the Obama administration on issues of surveillance and civil liberties, Katrina vanden Heuvel said in an online column for The Washington Post. Some left-leaning lawmakers are not shying away from the issue, she said. Sen. Sanders, for example, has proposed a bill limiting National Security Agency spying.   VA Health Care: The White House fought on Tuesday to contain the growing political furor over allegations of misconduct at the nation's veterans hospitals as Republicans, eager to use the issue in the midterm elections, seized on the reports as new evidence that President Obama is unable to govern effectively. Sen. Sanders, the Senate veterans panel chairman, said he was willing to work with Republicans to improve health care in the system, but he warned against using the allegations as a political weapon. ''I am going to do everything I can to prevent V.A. health care from being politicized,'' Sanders told The New York Times.

Save Net Neutrality:   In a Senate floor speech Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders read some of the more than 19,000 comments that consumers sent through his Senate website to the Federal Communications Commission demanding a free and open Internet. Sanders also urged President Barack Obama to reassert his support for net neutrality, a stand Obama took when he first ran for the White House in 2008.  After the FCC signaled it would consider new rules governing the Internet, Sanders invited visitors to use a form on his Senate website to weigh in on what he called a “terribly misguided” proposal. The FCC is considering a policy that would let companies like Comcast and Verizon divide the Internet into fast and slow lanes and give major corporations a significant advantage over small Internet startups and grassroots political organizations.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Health Care: The White House is “scrambling to contain growing outrage over delays in treatment and rigged recordkeeping at veterans hospitals, even as officials say they will wait for the results of an internal review at the Department of Veterans Affairs before taking any action against high-ranking officials,” according to a Washington Post web report. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernard Sanders said in an interview Monday with the Post that politicization of the issue would be "unconscionable." He said representatives of service organizations who testified before his committee last week agreed that VA continues to provide quality health care to veterans. "Obviously, there's an issue that we must focus on — the issue of access and getting veterans into the system and, very significantly, the issue of waiting times," Sanders said.   Sanders Supports Veterans: “I hope that the VA scandal makes it clear to anyone paying attention that the very government agency investigating the disgrace, the U.S Congress, is the same agency that denied the proposal by Sen. Sanders to increase VA funding in order to pay for more staff and new facilities. Our Veterans served with valor and honor; they deserve the medical care that they earned,” Andrew Schoerke of Veterans for Peace wrote in a letter to the editor of the Bennington Banner.   Vermont Yankee: Sen. Sanders said it's very important that states are involved in all decisions related to decommissioning nuclear power plants. Under current rules, public hearings can be held to take input, but in the end, the operator and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are the only entities that have any real say in how a plant is decommissioned, said Sanders. "We need to make sure that states that are undergoing decommissioning have a real seat at the table so they can participate in the best way to decommission a plant,” he told the Brattleboro Reformer and Bennington Banner.   Credit Suisse Pleads Guilty in Felony Case: Credit Suisse has done what no other bank of its size and significance has done in over two decades: plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing. In a sign that banking giants are no longer immune from criminal charges, despite concerns that financial institutions have grown so large and interconnected that they are too big to jail, federal prosecutors demanded that Credit Suisse’s parent company plead guilty to helping thousands of American account holders hide their wealth. As part of a deal announced on Monday, the Swiss bank met the demands, agreeing to one count of conspiring to aid tax evasion in a scheme that “spanned decades.” Credit Suisse, which has a giant investment bank in New York and whose chief executive is an American, will also pay about $2.6 billion in penalties and hire an independent monitor for up to two years, The New York Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Road Funds: Sen.

The U.S. Senate public works committee passed the $265 billion transportation funding bill Thursday, The Associated Press reported in an article published by the Burlington Free Press, Brattleboro Reformer, Bennington Banner and Valley News.

VA Health Care: Whistle-blowers claim that up to 40 veterans died while awaiting treatment at the VA hospital in Phoenix and that administrators there, and at seven other VA hospitals, tried to cover up the long wait times. President Obama said he stands by VA Secretary Eric Shinseki but ordered White House deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors to oversee the VA`s response to the controversy. Shinseki and his deputy faced withering questions at a Senate hearing, according to a report by NBC News’ Pentagon correspondent broadcast Sunday on “Meet the Press.” “Are people quote, unquote cooking the books?” Sen. Sanders asked. “I`m not aware, and other than a number of isolated cases,” the retired general said.  U.S. Accuses Chinese of Cyberspying: The Department of Justice on Monday will announce charges it has filed against several individuals in China’s People’s Liberation Army, accusing them of stealing trade secrets from American companies and marking the first time the United States has charged government employees with economic espionage, according to law enforcement officials, The New York Times reported.   Obama Angry Over Falsification of Veterans Affairs Data, Chief of Staff Says:  President Obama is “madder than hell” about reports that some medical facilities run by the Department of Veterans Affairs have falsified data to hide substantial delays for veterans to see doctors, and he has demanded that the department’s leaders “fix these things,” the White House chief of staff said in an interview aired Sunday. Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, said on the CBS News program “Face the Nation” that substantial increases in resources have been devoted to veterans care under Obama. Dan Dellinger, the American Legion commander, also was on the program. He said that under the Veterans Affairs secretary, Eric K. Shinseki, “Accountability hasn’t been there,” adding that there had been “egregious mismanagement of the entire system,” The New York Times reported.

"The window of opportunity is narrowing," he cautioned. "But we can lead by example. We can lead this nation and we can lead the world."  VA Health: Care Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, conceded there are problems at the VA but noted real progress. He praised the quality of care and noted the underpublicized horrors of our private health care system. ‘It’s important to put VA health care in context,’” he said, according to New York Daily News. Columnist James Warren cited a major reduction in homelessness among veterans, technological modernization that has cut a disability claims backlog, advances in telemedicine that help veterans avoid long travel to VA centers while letting the VA help more vets at less cost to taxpayers; an expansion of community-based outpatient clinics; and solid work on alternatives to addictive pain killers.

"It's one thing to be on a waiting list," said Griffin in the Los Angeles Times. "It's another thing to conclude that as a result of being on a waiting list, that was the cause of death." Results from the investigation are due in August, Military Times reported.   Sanders: Don’t Politicize Vets: Chairman Sanders said he fears a rush to judgment, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, National Public Radio, CBS News, MSNBC, Fox News, Politico, Al Jazeera America, Seven Days, New York Daily News, Newsday and Esquire reported. “If we’re going to do our job in a proper and responsible way, we need to get the facts and not rush to judgment,” he said.

The chairman of the Senate committee said there were "serious problems" at the VA but lawmakers must avoid a rush to judgment. "I don't want to see the VA system undermined," Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Associated Press. "I want to see it improved. I want these problems addressed." "If people are cooking the books, running second books, that is wrong.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Income Gap Worries Fed Chief: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testified Wednesday before Congress' Joint Economic Committee and told Sen. Bernie Sanders that there is "no question that we’ve had a trend toward growing inequality and I personally find it a very worrisome,” The Nation reported.  In remarks broadcast by C-SPAN, Bloomberg TV, Fox Business Network and CNBC, Yellen added that “the trend deserves the attention of policy makers.”  But when Sanders asked if it makes sense to give “enormous tax breaks to the families of the top 1 percent,” Yellen said “it’s up to the Congress to decide what’s appropriate,” Bloomberg reported.  Yellen was ‘Masterful’: The Wall Street Journal’s “Market Watch” gushed that “Yellen did a masterful job navigating the political shoals of the Joint Economic Committee. She told liberal Vermont Sen. Sanders that she shared his concern about the Koch brothers and inequality, and conservative Indiana Sen. Dan Coats that Congress needed to act soon to reduce long-term budget deficits.                                                          Global Warming: Sen.

In her first appearance before Congress as the nation’s central banker, the new Fed chief told Sanders that “there is no question that we’ve had a trend toward growing inequality and I personally find it a very worrisome trend that deserves the attention of policy makers.” Yellen added that “it greatly concerns me” that the growing wealth and income gap “can shape and determine the ability of different groups to participate equally in the  democracy and have grave effects on social stability over time.”  Read more here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/fed-chief-us-income-and-wealth-inequality-is-very-worrisome Watch Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Global Warming: Global warming could make the United States 10 degrees warmer by the end of this century, according to a National Climate Assessment report issued at the White House on Tuesday. “Most people who aren`t under the influence of the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry know the severity of the problem and understand that, if we do not get our act together and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels into energy efficiency, into sustainable energy, this planet is going to face huge problems in the years to come,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Chris Hayes in an interview Tuesday on MSNBC.   Climate Change: Sanders has introduced legislation with Sen. Barbara Boxer, the Senate environment committee chairman, proposing a fee on carbon and methane to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the Burlington Free Press reported. Another Sanders bill would end tax breaks and subsidies for oil and coal companies. Both ideas are backed by scientists and leading economists but have been blocked by Republicans in Congress who dismiss climate change, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.   New Fed Chief to Testify: Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will be on Capitol Hill for the first time on Wednesday as the nation’s central banker to testify about the economic outlook before the Joint Economic Committee. “I want her thoughts about how we deal with the crisis of long-term unemployment,” Sen. Sanders told The Wall Street Journal’s “Market Watch.” “I want her thoughts on the very significant issue of how we deal with income and wealth inequality in America."   College Cost Crisis: With the average student graduating $27,000 in debt in what Sen. Sanders calls a crisis of college affordability. “The fact that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of young people who are bright, who would like to get a higher education, have now decided, because they do not want to leave school deeply in debt, that they are not going to go to college,” Sanders said in a Senate speech broadcast on WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV. He's drafting legislation to allow low-income students to pursue college courses while they are in high school. He also backs legislation to rein in rising student loan interest rates.

Congress Must Confront Global Warming Crisis:   Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called for Congress to act on proposals to curb greenhouse gas emissions after a major new report today warned that global warming could exceed 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the United States by the end of this century.  “This important report is another loud and clear warning that greenhouse gases are rising faster than ever and our refusal to recognize and deal with the crisis could have catastrophic consequences,” said Sanders, a member of the Senate energy and environment committees.  “It is no longer acceptable for a majority in Congress to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence. It is no longer acceptable that coal and oil companies spend millions of dollars to defeat efforts to protect the planet,” Sanders added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Wage: Many Republicans, who last week blocked the Senate from considering a bill to raise the minimum wage, disagree with the concept of a minimum wage, Sen. Sanders told Tavis Smiley on PBS during an interview on Monday. On MSNBC, Sanders told Ed Schultz that lifting the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would create jobs and stimulate the economy. “If working people don't have any money to spend because they're earning starvation wages, we're not going to create the types of jobs we have to create” to reduce unemployment, Sanders said.   Net Neutrality: Sen. Sanders’ opposition to new Internet deregulation proposals from the Federal Communications Commission was the hot topic on the popular social media website Reddit last week. Reddit General Manager Erik Martin told The Verge he hopes more political figures will appear on Reddit in opposition to the proposals which would allow Internet providers to divide the web into fast and slow lanes. Sanders has encouraged net neutrality supporters to send their thoughts to FCC, Daily Kos reported.   Citizens United: Extending political rights to corporations unfairly gives greater political representation to corporate owners, Steve Todd said in a letter to The (Harrisburg, Pa.) Patriot-News. Sen. Sanders summed it up best when he said, "Ben is a person; Jerry is a person; Ben and Jerry's is not a person."   Holder: Banks Aren't 'Too Big to Jail': Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday "there is no such thing as ‘too big to jail,’” noting Justice Department efforts to move toward criminal charges against large financial institutions, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Tops on Twitter and Facebook Too:  Time magazine selected Sen. Bernie Sanders for its annual list of the “most influential Twitter feeds.” Said Time, “He’s a loud conscience for liberal principles. He highlights poverty statistics, tweaks his colleagues for voting against veterans’ benefits and slams the industrialist Koch brothers for their political spending. At a time when political and economic populism has grown in fits and starts, Sanders is a voice consistently railing against inequality.” When it comes to social media, The Washington Post Wonkblog last week reported that Sanders “has one of the largest and most enthusiastic social media followings out there.” The Post called it “astonishing” that nearly 30 times as many people were engaged with Sanders’ Facebook page than were interacting at the same time with Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republicans’ 2012 VP candidate. Sanders said the credit goes to people like you who are concerned about the future of our country and understand that we need a serious discussion about serious issues.  “Let's keep the serious discussions going and get even more friends, family and coworkers involved in the dialogue.”  Read the Time list here: http://time.com/84178/bernie-sanders-twitter-feeds-follow-2014/  Read more at Wonkblog here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/04/28/congressional-republicans-have-more-facebook-fans-but-democrats-are-more-energized/

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Food Labels: Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin this week is expected to sign into law a bill that would require labels on food products that contain genetically modified ingredients — a first of its kind for any state. For two years in a row, the U.S. Senate has soundly defeated amendments proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders that would have made clear that states had the legal authority to require labeling, Congressional Quarterly reported.   Pfizer Avoids US Taxes: Drugs giant Pfizer will face a grilling today from U.S. shareholders over its takeover bid for Britain’s AstraZeneca. The acquisition is aimed at moving Pfizer’s tax domicile to the United Kingdom in order to deprive U.S. coffers of billions of dollars. Sen. Sanders put Pfizer on a list of ‘Top Ten Corporate Tax Avoiders,’ claiming it paid no income taxes from 2010 to 2012 and that it received $2.2billion of tax refunds from the IRS at the same time as making $43 billion in worldwide profit, London’s Daily Mail reported.   Keystone Pipeline Looms as Senate Takes up Energy Bill: The impassioned debate over the Keystone XL pipeline could reach a tipping point this week on Capitol Hill, with this likely the last chance for the issue to be considered legislatively until after the November midterm elections. The outcome could complicate matters for the Obama administration, which is still reviewing whether to allow permits for sections of the pipeline. The Senate is set to begin debate on a modest energy bill that has enough bipartisan support to pass on its own merits, but supporters of the pipeline, which is intended to transport oil from western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast, are trying to leverage the bill to force votes on Keystone, The Washington Post reported.   China Poised to Overtake US Economy: China is advancing rapidly to overtake the United States as the biggest economy in the world, new data shows, with the leader of the world economy since the 19th century possibly losing its top spot to the Asian giant later this year. "The United States remained the world's largest economy (in 2011), but it was closely followed by China" once data was adjusted for comparison on a standard basis, the World Bank said in a report last week. India is now the world’s third largest economy, moving ahead of Japan, Agence France-Presse reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/050514

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Ukraine: Ukrainian ­authorities vowed Saturday to restore control over the roiling eastern part of their nation, slowly advancing on two key breakaway cities even as the Kremlin and its supporters in Ukraine said the violence demanded a response. The military operations Saturday claimed at least 10 lives, medical officials said, a day after a conflagration in a trade union building killed ­dozens of pro-Russian activists in the port city of Odessa in the bloodiest day in Ukraine in nearly three months, The Washington Post reported.  Reports Gather Dust: Every year, the U.S. government prepares an official report to Congress on Dog and Cat Fur Protection. It takes at least 15 employees in at least six different federal offices. The data are written into a report, passed up the chain of command and sent to Capitol Hill. Then nothing happens. This Congress is officially expecting 4,291 written reports, from 466 federal agencies and nonprofit groups, including two reports from the association of veterans of the Spanish-American War. The last member of that group died in 1992. Congress is not even sure how many of those 4,291 reports are actually turned in. And it does not try to save copies of all the ones that are. So some agencies cheat and send in nothing. And others waste time and money sending in reports that disappear into the void, The Washington Post reported.  Nuclear Plant Safety: Five U.S. senators, including Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernard Sanders of Vermont, have sent a letter to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to protest what they called the “unwise policy” of allowing decommissioning nuclear reactors to be exempt from emergency response regulations, The Associated Press, Rutland Herald and WPTZ-TV reported on Sunday.  Civil War Veteran and Sister Honored: Military veterans and Civil War re-enactors turned out Saturday for a memorial service for a Strafford, Vermont, brother and sister who died about 150 years ago. The service was for Amelia Roberts, who died of typhoid fever in 1859, and Vermont Infantry Pvt. George Roberts, killed in the Battle of the Wilderness in Virginia on May 5 and 6, 1864. During the ceremony, the family received from Sen. Sanders an American flag that was flown over the U.S. Capitol., the Valley News reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Phoenix VA: The Department of Veterans Affairs’ inspector general is investigating claims that a Phoenix VA hospital tried to cover up deaths of patients placed on waiting lists. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Senate veterans’ committee chairman, pledged to hold a hearing after the probe is completed into the “very serious” allegations. He stressed, however, that overall the VA provides better care at less cost than private hospitals. He also told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC that some attacks on the VA are rooted in an “anti-government mentality” by critics in a “highly-politicized” Washington.   Record Road Rebuilding: After a tough winter, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin announced Friday that Vermont will improve 375 miles of state and federal roads and highways as part of the largest paving effort in the state's history. Sen. Sanders secured a provision in a 2012 highway bill that will bring an additional $9 million to the state, The Associated Press, WCAX-TV, WPTZ-TV, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.   Nuclear Plant Safety: Five U.S. senators on Friday warned that federal regulators need to keep more emergency and security regulations in place at shuttered nuclear power plants that store tons of spent radioactive fuel. In a letter to Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Allison Macfarlane, Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and three other senators said the agency that oversees the nation's commercial nuclear industry has been freeing closed plants from certain emergency and security safeguards even though the spent fuel on site remains dangerous for years to come, AP, National Journal, Times Argus and Brattleboro Reformer reported.  Tax-Evasion Law Unenforced: The Treasury Department will relax enforcement of a new law aimed at discouraging offshore tax dodging, at least for financial institutions that are making good-faith efforts to comply, The Wall Street Journal reported. The announcement on Friday doesn't postpone the July 1 implementation of the law, known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, but the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service won't rigorously enforce many of the law's requirements for 2014 and 2015, as long as firms are trying to cooperate, according to the notice.

The Week in Review:  Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked consideration of a bill that would boost the federal minimum wage.  Sen. Bernie Sanders was disappointed but not surprised. A proposal before the Federal Communications Commission to let service providers sell fast lanes on the Internet has drawn more than 14,000 comments, mostly critical, since it was first posted Tuesday evening on Sanders’ website. On the court beat, the Supreme Court on Tuesday handed an important victory to the Environmental Protection Agency, former Justice John Paul Stevens testified in favor of a constitutional amendment to undo a decision that struck down campaign funding laws, and a federal judge in Wisconsin breathed life into the Voting Rights Act.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Republicans Want to Abolish the Minimum Wage: Senate Republicans this week blocked a bill to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour. Many Republicans not only oppose raising the minimum wage, they want to abolish the concept of the minimum wage altogether, Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz in an interview Thursday on MSNBC. At a June 2013 hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander suggested the concept of the minimum wage should be abolished - a stance which was challenged by Sanders, Chris Hayes reported on MSNBC. “If you work 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty,” Sanders said on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell.   Budget for Billionaires: Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal is tailor-made for the Koch brothers and other billionaires, Sen. Sanders told Chris Jansing on MSNBC Thursday. “It is very clear the Republican Party has become a right-wing extremist party,” Sanders said. “I think the American people have got to become aware of that, and we have to fight back and create an economy that works for the middle class and not for billionaires.”   The Koch Brothers: In a Senate floor speech on Thursday, Sen. Sanders said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and others are simply trying to educate the public on what the Koch brothers are buying with their campaign contributions. “It’s important that we know what the Koch brothers believe,” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech on Thursday. He said the Republican Party priorities have evolved into what used to be “extremist” libertarian, anti-government views advocated by the Kochs, The Hill reported online.   Unemployment at 12.3%: Real unemployment fell to 12.3 percent in April, the Department of Labor announced on Friday. The rate was down from 12.7 percent in March for the measurement that counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and those who have given up looking for work was Americans gained jobs at the fastest pace in more than two years last month and the official jobless rate dropped to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent. Unemployment hit the lowest level since September 2008 in part because the overall labor force shrank sharply last month. The jobless rate is still historically high, above the roughly 4 percent rate in the months before the recession began in 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Paul vs. The People: http://youtu.be/H-1O0hJVwSc
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Republicans Block Minimum Wage Bill: Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked a bill that would gradually increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. “It really does astound me that at a time when our Republican friends in the house are voting to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and large corporations, they don't have it in their hearts to give us at least a $10.10 minimum wage, which would take so many people out of poverty,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC.   Phoenix VA: Department of Veterans Affairs officials told senators Wednesday that the investigation into allegations of a secret waiting list for medical appointments at the Phoenix VA so far has turned up no evidence that such a list exists. Veterans Committee Chairman Sanders vowed to “get to the bottom of what has happened in Phoenix,” while reaching conclusions “based on an objective investigation of the facts — not TV reports.” Sanders said the allegations should not be allowed "to impugn excellent work done throughout this country by hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses and administrators on all levels” at the VA, The Associated Press reported.   Senate to Vote on Campaign Finance Amendment: A string of Supreme Court decisions, starting in with a 2010 ruling in Citizens United vs. the FEC, enabled the nation's wealthiest donors to anonymously contribute unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. Sen. Chuck Schumer on Wednesday promised to hold a Senate vote this year on a constitutional amendment to allow restrictions on campaign spending. It is unclear if any potential presidential candidates will run on the issue in the 2016 election. So far, only Sen. Sanders has indicated that he would campaign heavily against the influence of big donors and corporate interests in politics, The Boston Globe reported.   Economy Sputters: The Commerce Department said Wednesday that American gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.1% in the first quarter as weakness overseas hurt exports and frigid weather curtailed business investment, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Net Neutrality: Federal Communications Commissioner Tom Wheeler, a former industry lobbyist, has proposed new rules that would allow Internet service providers to charge web publishers extra for preferential treatment - giving them a fast lane on the Internet highway. Sen. Sanders called the idea "terribly misguided" and said that, if enacted, "the Internet as we have come to know it would cease to exist and the average American would be the big loser,” the Long Island (N.Y.) Populist Examiner said.  Senate to Vote on Minimum Wage: Hike Hemmed in by solid Republican opposition, the Senate seems ready to hand a fresh defeat to President Barack Obama by blocking an election-year bill increasing the federal minimum wage. Democrats, aware that the measure faces all but certain rejection Wednesday in the chamber they control, plan to use the vote to buttress their campaign theme that the GOP is unwilling to protect financially struggling families, The Associated Press reported.   Too Big to Jail?: Federal prosecutors are nearing criminal charges against some of the world’s biggest banks, according to The New York Times. The credit crisis of 2008 dwarfed earlier financial busts. So far, however, only one junior executive at a Wall Street bank has been sent to prison. In the past, the New York Stock Exchange chief landed in prison after the 1929 crash. Some 1,100 people were prosecuted after the savings-and-loan scandals of the 1980s. Top executives from WorldCom, Enron, Qwest and Tyco went to prison after the tech collapse in the ‘90s exposed widespread corporate accounting scandals.   Supreme Court Backs Coal Pollution Rules: The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate coal-plant pollution that wafts across state lines from 27 Midwestern and Appalachian states to eastern states, The New York Times reported. The 6-to-2 ruling is a major environmental victory for the Obama administration, which has instituted several new EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act in an effort to crack down on coal pollution.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  Stop Being Defensive: Democrats “have to stop being defensive” about the Affordable Care Act and aggressively call out Republican governors in more than 20 states who have refused to expand Medicaid, Sen. Bernie Sanders told the Rev. Al Sharpton during an interview Monday on MSNBC. “We have got to tell every governor out there who was denying people the right to have health care that they`re doing a terrible, terrible thing. We`ve got to start turning the tables on them,” Sanders said. The health care law, Sanders stressed, lets states cover more people at no cost to the states.   Thank You: Sen. Sanders’ Facebook page has the greatest level of engagement in Congress, according to The Washington Post. Sanders “has one of the largest and most enthusiastic social media followings out there,” according to the article, which called it “astonishing” that nearly 30 times as many people were talking about Sanders on Facebook on Monday compared to Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republicans’ 2012 candidate for vice president.  Also on Monday, Sanders won a “Gold Mouse” award from the Congressional Management Foundation for his use of social media to keep constituents informed, The Hill reported.  Older Americans: Negotiations have stalled over a Senate bill to reauthorize programs that provide social and nutrition services for seniors, Congressional Quarterly said. Sen. Sanders opposes a proposed change which would significantly cut funding in some states. "That just does not make any sense to me at all," said Sanders, who has proposed increased funding for Older Americans Act programs like Meals on Wheels.   VA in Phoenix: Speaking at a news conference in the Philippines, President Barack Obama pledged to get to the bottom of allegations that a Veterans Affairs Department hospital in Phoenix tried to cover up delays in service that led to as many as 40 veterans’ deaths. Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said his panel will hold a hearing after the completion of an independent investigation, according to The Washington Post online and the Phoenix New Times.

Our free and open Internet has made invaluable contributions to democracy both here in the United States and around the world. Whether you are rich, poor, young or old, the Internet allows all people to seek out information and communicate globally.
 
 Federal Communications Commissioner Tom Wheeler reportedly plans to vote on a rule change that would undermine the principles of net neutrality and let companies like Comcast and Verizon divide the internet into fast and slow lanes. This proposal would end the Internet as we know it. We must not let private corporations turn bigger and bigger profits by putting a price tag on the free flow of ideas.

On the Road: Sen. Bernie Sanders over the weekend took his fight for progressive politics to stops in South Carolina, North Carolina and  Minnesota.  In Charleston, S.C., on Friday, he spoke to a packed meeting at the College of Charleston about the high cost of college education and student indebtedness, the need for a national health care system guaranteeing health care for all and how income and wealth inequality are moving our country to an oligarchic form of government.  Sanders also talked about the  success of the billionaire Koch brothers in moving the Republican Party to the far right. On Friday evening, Sanders spoke to another large crowd in Charleston at the Longshoreman's union hall.  He focused on the need for a massive federal jobs program to address the unemployment crisis.  He also called for a significant increase in the minimum wage, an issue expected to come up for a vote this week in the Senate.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Takes on Big-Money: “This country faces enormous problems,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told David Weigel of Slate. “We need people standing up for the working class and the middle class of this country, people prepared to take on the big-money interests who dominate our economic and political life. I am prepared to do that,”   The Supreme Court: Landmark decisions during the Obama presidency – such as demolishing restrictions on corporate and union campaign donations in the Citizens United case – guarantee flak from politicians who dislike the court’s conclusions. Sen. Sanders, for example, accused the court of “paving the way toward an oligarchic form of society,” according to The Hill, which cited concerns that the court’s authority is being eroded.   Minimum-Wage Plan on Senate Agenda: The Senate is expected this week to take up a long-stalled push to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, a measure that is likely to be defeated but one that Democrats see as a winner on the campaign trail. The idea of raising the $7.25-an-hour minimum wage is politically popular, according to polls, but Republicans hope the coming debate will allow them to promote their view that raising the wage will lead to job losses. A March Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 58 percent of people would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.   John Paul Stevens to Testify on ‘Dark Money’: The former Supreme Court justice will appear as the star witness at a Senate hearing on “dark money” Wednesday. The hearing is the first congressional probe into campaign finance since the high court’s decision to abolish aggregate donation caps in the McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission decision earlier this month. Stevens recently told The New Yorker that McCutcheon was “grossly incorrect” and he has been consistently critical of the shifting campaign finance landscape since the landmark Citizens United decision boosted the First Amendment rights of corporations. Sen. Angus King will chair the Senate Rules Committee hearing, Politico reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/042814

VA in Arizona: A congressional inquiry and a watchdog probe await the Department of Veterans Affairs after a Phoenix VA hospital allegedly tried to cover up delays in service for more than 1,400 sick veterans, some of whom died while waiting for care. The VA inspector general’s office has launched an investigation of the claims, and the head of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Sen. Sanders, has promised to hold a hearing on the matter after the review is complete, The Washington Post online, The Associated Press in Arizona and Fox News reported.  A Threat to Health Care in Canada: The doctor who recently grabbed headlines across North America for defending Canada’s health system before an ornery U.S. Senate warned that a legal showdown before the Supreme Court for British Columbia could affect the future of health care in Canada. Dr. Danielle Martin is sounding the alarm over a case challenging the province’s ban on private health care and whether private clinics may extra-bill patients for medical services, the Toronto Star reported.  Obama Calls on Congress to Act on Minimum Wage and Unemployment Insurance: President Barack Obama continues to keep up the drumbeat for an unemployment extension and a minimum wage hike. On Saturday, Obama used his weekly radio address to push a $10.10 an hour minimum wage proposal, ahead of votes in the Senate when Congress returns next week. And on Friday,  the president used his advocacy arm, Organizing for Action, to call for Congress to pass an unemployment extension, Congressional Quarterly reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   FCC Threatens Net Neutrality: House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said reports of the FCC's plan "raise serious concerns that the Internet might soon lose the core of what it is." The proposal also faced criticism from Democratic Sens. Ed Markey, Cory Booker and Ron Wyden and independent Sen. Sanders, National Journal reported. Sanders said he opposes the “misguided” plan because it would weaken rules designed to ensure an open flow of information on the Internet, Daily Kos, and San Diego Jewish World reported.  Economic Issues Unite Americans: The billionaires can be taken on “if we stand together around economic issues,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told listeners to The Ed Shultz Show Friday. The American middle class, once the envy of the world, is disappearing as more people are living in poverty and the gap between the people on top and everybody else grows wider, Sanders said. Asked about a potential White House bid, Sanders said, “If I run, I’m going to run to win.”  Congress Needs to Tackle Economic Priorities: “If we are serious about rebuilding the middle class and putting millions of people back to work, we need a major federal jobs program that includes significant investments in our crumbling infrastructure, early childhood education and affordable housing,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Saturday by The (Willimantic, Conn.) Chronicle. Among the many other areas that Congress must focus on, Sanders listed raising the minimum wage to a living wage, expanding Social Security and addressing the planetary crisis of global warming.  Middle-Class Americans Live Hand-to-Mouth: A new Brookings Institution study found that two-thirds of U.S. households living "hand-to-mouth" are actually middle class, with homes and retirement assets. Only about one-third of those just getting by financially are what most would consider poor, with median incomes of about $20,000.

The Week in Review:   Internet traffic would be divided into fast and slow lanes under a proposal that surfaced Wednesday at the Federal Communications Commission. Sen. Bernie Sanders called it a “terribly misguided” idea that would suppress the free flow of information. Earth Day on Tuesday served as a sad reminder that Republicans in Congress have blocked legislation to deal with global warming, including Sanders’ bills to tax greenhouse gas emissions. The Koch brothers have tapped their $80 billion oil industry fortune to prop up candidates who stood in the way of environmental legislation. But anti-environmentalism is just one element of a right-wing agenda of the Koch brothers and their puppets. Sanders laid it all out in an MSNBC interview on Wednesday. At home in Vermont for Congress’ Easter recess, Sanders on Thursday shined a spotlight on the state’s network of community health centers. On Wednesday, he congratulated Vermont lawmakers for passing a bill to make the Green Mountain State the first in the nation to require labels on food that includes genetically modified ingredients.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Internet Plan at Odds with Obama Stand: An FCC proposal that could empower Internet providers for faster service clashes with one of President Obama’s oldest campaign promises. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the FCC proposal “terribly misguided,” and said, if enacted, the new rule would “let private corporations turn bigger and bigger profits by putting a price tag on the free flow of ideas,” The Nation, Politico, The Hill, The New Republic, National Journal and Multichannel News reported.  Sanders Touts Health Centers: Emphasizing the need to improve access to primary health care across the country, Sen. Sanders and Obama administration health officials showed off Vermont’s successful federally-funded community health centers as a “model for the nation,” WCAX-TV and the Burlington Free Press reported. Asked if health care would be a campaign issue if he runs for president in 2016, Sanders said he has been concerned with the issue of health care access his entire life, according to Vermont Public Radio.  Lobbyists Attack Sanders’ Carbon Tax: A total of 36 companies and organizations reported lobbying Congress in the first quarter of the year on legislation by Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer that would impose a fee on big carbon polluters, Bloomberg reported.   Food Labels: Vermont will likely be the first state in the nation to require food manufacturers to label products containing genetically modified organisms. Gov. Peter Shumlin said Wednesday he will sign Vermont's GMO labeling bill into law. Sen. Sanders, who is pushing for federal labeling reform, congratulated the Vermont Legislature. “I am very proud our small state stood up to Monsanto and other multi-national food conglomerates and is taking the lead in a movement to allow the people of our country to know what is in the food that they eat,” Sanders said in the Brattleboro Reformer.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Vermont to Require GMO Food Labels: Vermont will likely be the first state in the nation to require food manufacturers to label products containing genetically modified organisms. Minutes after the House voted 114-30 for the bill, Gov. Peter Shumlin said he will sign it into law. Sen. Sanders, who is pushing for federal food label reforms, congratulated state lawmakers, VTDigger reported. “I am very proud our small state stood up to Monsanto and other multi-national food conglomerates and is taking the lead in a movement to allow the people of our country to know what is in the food that they eat," Sanders said.   An American Agenda: “It is clear to me that the president and Congress have got to start listening to the American people and acting on their behalf rather than representing the needs of corporate America and the rich,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Thursday by the Philadelphia Daily News, Athens (Ga.) Banner-Herald and The (Doylestown, Pa.) Intelligencer. He said Congress must enact a major jobs program that invests in our crumbling infrastructure, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, protect and expand Social Security and address the planetary crisis of global warming.  Koch Brothers and Their Puppets: Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to elect right-wing candidates who will enact an agenda that’s good for billionaires but bad for working families in America, Sen. Sanders told Ed Schultz Wednesday on MSNBC. Sanders said the vast majority of Americans disagree with the Kochs, who want more tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. “Do you really want to live in a country where a handful of billionaires control our economy and our political life while the middle class disappears?” Sanders asked. “That is the question of our time. We’ve got to stand up and fight back.”   New FCC Rule Undermines Net Neutrality: Regulators at the Federal Communications Commission plan to introduce a new rules that will undermine net neutrality and allow large internet corporations to offer “preferential treatment” to websites who pay them off, The Huffington Post reported. Critics argue that the end of net neutrality could have far-reaching effects on U.S. society by stifling innovation, hindering cash-strapped Internet startups from getting off the ground and widening the gap between the rich and the poor in the quality of Internet connection each get.

The Koch Brothers and the Puppets They Control:   The Koch brothers for decades operated in the shadows of American public life while pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into front groups promoting what Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the “billionaire agenda.” Now Republicans are trying to silence Koch brother critics like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  So what are the Republicans trying to hide? It’s not well known, but David Koch was the 1980 Libertarian Party candidate for vice president. He campaigned on a platform that called for abolishing taxes on the wealthy and profitable corporations, shutting down Medicare and Medicaid, repealing Social Security, putting the Postal Service out of business and doing away with the minimum wage. “They want to repeal every major piece of legislation over the past 80 years that protects the middle class, the elderly, the children, the sick and the most vulnerable in our country,” Bernie said. Once Americans know what the Koch brothers stand for, Sanders told Ed Schultz on Wednesday, they will stand up to them and to “the puppets that they control.”  Watch Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   College Costs Soaring: Sen. Bernie Sanders discussed the high cost of college education and spiraling student loan interest rates during an appearance on Tuesday at Rutland High School, WCAX-TV reported. Students “listened eagerly during an issue-packed speech by Sanders,” the Rutland Herald reported.   State of the Union: Sen. Sanders held a town hall-style discussion with students at Mount Anthony Union High School on Tuesday in order to honor junior Alexina Federhen, who won the senator’s State of the Union essay contest in January, the Bennington Banner reported. “It pleases me to hear kids thinking about the issues facing our country and coming up with ideas on how we can solve it,” Sanders told WNYT-TV in Albany, N.Y.   The Billionaire Agenda: Fueled by $3.4 million of his own money and Tea Party support, Curt Clawson on Tuesday won a special Republican congressional primary in Florida. Discussing big donors’ impact on campaigns, MSNBC’s Ed Schultz showed Sen. Bernie Sanders warning about a “billionaire agenda.” “The senator has been right on this issue for years,” Schultz said.  “A shrinking number of super-rich people have been buying elections around this country.   American Middle Class Falls Behind: Although economic growth in the United States continues to be as strong as in many other countries, or stronger, most of the income gains are flowing to a relatively small slice of high-earning households, stripping the American middle class of its former distinction as the richest in the world, The New York Times reported. Between 2000 and 2010, median income in Canada rose 20 percent and pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and has most likely surpassed it since then.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Food Labels: Vermont may become the first state in the nation to require labels on food containing genetically-modified ingredients. The Senate and House have passed similar bills and are working out the differences. Sen. Bernie Sanders was quoted in a Bennington Banner editorial saying, “I am very proud that Vermont is taking the lead in a growing national movement to allow the people of our country to know what is in the food they eat. GMO labeling exists in dozens of countries around the world and should exist in the United States,” Sanders said.   Older Americans Act: Underfunded Sen. Sanders and 26 of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate say in a new letter to Senate appropriators that persistent underfunding of the Older Americans Act is leading to unnecessary nursing home placements and hospitalizations related to poor nutrition and chronic health conditions, Reverse Mortgage Daily reported. The lawmakers requested a 12 percent increase over last year’s funding levels.   U.S. Warns Russia on Ukraine Accord: Russia has "days, not weeks" to abide by an international accord aimed at stemming the crisis in Ukraine, the top U.S. diplomat in Kiev warned Monday as Vice President Joe Biden launched a high-profile show of support for the pro-Western Ukrainian government. Russia in turn accused authorities in Kiev of flagrantly violating the pact and declared their actions would not stand, The Associated Press reported.   Student Debt: Government officials are trying to rein in popular federal programs that forgive some student debt. Enrollment in the plans—which allow students to rack up big debts and then forgive the unpaid balance after a set period—has surged nearly 40 percent in just six months, U.S. Education Department records show. The fastest-growing plan requires borrowers to pay 10 percent a year of their discretionary income in monthly installments. Unpaid balances for those working in the public sector or for nonprofits are then forgiven after 10 years, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Headed to NC State: Sen. Bernie Sanders will speak at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C., on Saturday. He will discuss rising college tuition, the increased threat of climate change and the growing role of money in politics, the student newspaper The Technician reported.   Politics and Pitchforks: “Big money pervades and corrupts our politics, undercutting populist impulses in the political class … Only the rare few — Sens. Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown— risk standing as champions of the people,” Robert Borosage of the Campaign for America's Future wrote for Truthout.   Koch Brothers in Vermont: “The American Legislative Exchange Council is almost entirely funded by … the big-money oligarchs who our independent Sen. Sanders has been warning us about,” David Quigley of Winooski wrote in a letter to the editor of the Times Argus.  Boston Marathon: One year after a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs killed three people and wounded more than 260 others at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, about 36,000 runners have registered for today’s race — the second-largest field in its history, many of them coming to show support for the event and the city that was shocked by the attack on its signature sporting event, The Associated Press reported.

The Richer You Are the Older You’ll Get - Josh Zumbrun, The Wall Street Journal:   Money may not buy love, but it appears to buy years.  Economist Barry Bosworth at the Brookings Institution crunched the numbers and found that the richer you are, the longer you’ll live. And it’s a gap that is widening, particularly among women.  Mr. Bosworth parsed this data from the University of Michigan’s Health and Retirement Study, a survey that tracks the health and work-life of 26,000 Americans as they age and retire. The data is especially valuable as it tracks the same individuals every two years in what’s known as a longitudinal study, to see how their lives unfold.  The good news is that men of all incomes are living longer. Yet the data shows that the life expectancy of the wealthy is growing much faster than the life expectancy of the poor.  Here’s the sort of detail this remarkable data set can show. You can look at a man born in 1940 and see that during the 1980s, the mid-point of his career, his income was in the top 10% for his age group. If that man lives to age 55 he can expect to live an additional 34.9 years, or to the age of 89.9. That’s six years longer than a man whose career followed the same arc, but who was born in 1920.

Princeton Study: U.S. No Longer An Actual Democracy - Brendan James, Talking Points Memo:   A new study from Princeton spells bad news for American democracy—namely, that it no longer exists.  Asking "[w]ho really rules?" researchers Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page argue that over the past few decades America's political system has slowly transformed from a democracy into an oligarchy, where wealthy elites wield most power.  Using data drawn from over 1,800 different policy initiatives from 1981 to 2002, the two conclude that rich, well-connected individuals on the political scene now steer the direction of the country, regardless of or even against the will of the majority of voters.  "The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy," they write, "while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence."  As one illustration, Gilens and Page compare the political preferences of Americans at the 50th income percentile to preferences of Americans at the 90th percentile as well as major lobbying or business groups. They find that the government—whether Republican or Democratic—more often follows the preferences of the latter group rather than the first.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   College Costs: Sen. Sanders heard this week from college students in Vermont who expressed "very serious concerns about the high cost of college." Sanders told The Thom Hartmann Program on Friday that increasing numbers of students are "shackled with these terrible, terrible debts," and are being "forced to go into professions they don't want to do.”  Koch Brothers: Sen. Sanders describes what it is that the Kochs have in mind for a future American plutocracy “and it's ugly,” a blogger wrote for the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal. Sanders' "must-read article" posted on Truthdig, lays out the David Koch-backed 1980 Libertarian Party platform, which called for the abolition, repeal or termination of "every major piece of legislation that has been signed into law over the past 80 years that has protected the middle class, the elderly, the children, the sick and the most vulnerable in this society," John Colson wrote in The Aspen (Colo.) Times.    'Superrich' Pay Lower Taxes Than 'Very Rich': Figures just released by the Internal Revenue Service show the super-rich – those who report adjusted gross incomes of more than $10 million – paid 20.4 percent of their income in federal income taxes in 2011, a significantly lower rate than the 24.5 percent paid by the very rich – those earning more than $500,000 but less than $10 million, The New York Times reported. This is largely due to the fact that investment income – which makes up a large portion of the super-rich's earnings – is taxed at a lower rate than income.

The Week in Review:   The United Nations warned on Sunday that we’re running out of time to deal with global warming. Tuesday was the IRS deadline for filing tax returns and a reminder that many profitable corporations – like GE and Verizon – have paid no federal income taxes in recent years. The Consumer Protection Financial Bureau warned on Monday that student loan interest rates are likely to go up in July. Sen. Bernie Sanders congratulated Vermont senators on Wednesday for moving the state closer to becoming the first in the nation to require labels on genetically-modified food. And on Thursday, Sanders exposed the history of the Koch brothers’ pro-rich and anti-working people, anti-EPA, anti-education, anti-Medicare, anti-Social Security agenda.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Who are the Koch Brothers?: The billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch are using the fortune that they inherited to fund campaigns by candidates who believe in tax breaks for the wealthiest people and major cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and education, Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an interview Thursday on MSNBC. “They are, the Koch brothers, helping to lead the war against working families in this country.”   What Do They Want?: Sen. Sanders “keen and brilliant insights” into the Koch brothers' extremist agenda were laid out in an op-ed by the senator for The Huffington Post, according to a Daily Kos blog. The Kochs’ objective “is to move this country from a democratic society with a strong middle class to an oligarchic form of society in which the economic and political life of the nation are controlled by a handful of billionaire families,” Sanders wrote in the column that also was posted at MichaelMoore.com, Green Mountain Daily, Op-Ed News and Daily Kos.  U.S. and Russia Agree on Pact to Defuse Ukraine Crisis: The United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union reached an agreement on Thursday evening that calls for armed pro-Russian bands to give up the government buildings they have seized in eastern Ukraine and outlines other steps to de-escalate the crisis, The New York Times reported. The agreement does not specifically require Russia to remove the approximately 40,000 troops it has on Ukraine’s border, nor does it commit Russia to holding direct talks with the interim Ukrainian government.   Obama: 8 Million Covered: President Barack Obama announced Thursday that eight million people have signed up for private health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and about 35 percent of those who signed up are under the age of 35, The Washington Post reported.

America’s Top 10 Corporate Tax Avoiders: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/top-10-corporate-tax-avoiders
Who are the Koch Brothers and What do They Want?:   As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, billionaires and large corporations can now spend an unlimited amount of money to influence the political process. The results of that decision are clear. In the coming months and years the Koch brothers and other extraordinarily wealthy families will spend billions of dollars to elect right-wing candidates to the Senate, the House, governors' mansions and the presidency of the United States. These billionaires already own much of our economy. That, apparently, is not enough. Now, they want to own the United States government as well.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  From Extreme to Mainstream: The Libertarian Party platform in 1980 called for abolishing the minimum wage, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and income taxes. David Koch was the candidate for vice president that year on a ticket headed by Edward Clark. They thought Ronald Reagan was too liberal. Back then, they got 1 percent of the vote. Today, David Koch and his brother Charles have turned those 1980 extremist ideas into mainstream Republican Party orthodoxy by putting their fortune behind right-wing politicians and think tanks. It’s all part of a campaign, Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a column for The Huffington Post, to “repeal every major piece of legislation that has been signed into law over the past 80 years that has protected the middle class, the elderly, the children, the sick and the most vulnerable in this country.”   The Fossil-Fuel Party: ‘It is not congressional opposition that is blocking progress” on global warming. “It is the fierce opposition by … the fossil-fuel-funded Republican Party,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a letter to the editor published in Thursday’s New York Times.   Vermont Senate Votes for GMO Food Labels: The Vermont Senate voted Wednesday to require labels on food that contains genetically-modified organisms. Sen. Sanders said he is proud that his state is "taking the lead in a growing national movement." Sanders earlier this year proposed an amendment to the farm bill that would have granted states the authority to require GMO labeling, Common Dreams reported.   VA Hospitals: Veterans being treated at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals have given the agency high marks in customer satisfaction, according to a survey conducted by an independent company. The American Customer Satisfaction Index, which conducts surveys for government and private sector services, rated the VA better as good or better than private sector hospitals  care, which place 80 and 83, respectively, on the index. Sen. Sanders, the Senate veterans’ committee chairman, said he hears positive things whenever he visits VA medical centers around the country, Military Times reported. “The patients I meet routinely tell me how pleased they are with the quality of care they receive," he said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders in New Hampshire: Chris Galdieri, an assistant professor of politics at St. Anselm College, was interviewed Tuesday by Vermont Public Radio about Sen. Sanders’ appearance at the school last weekend. “It went over very well. He attracted a large crowd. There were a lot of folks who were just very eager to hear what he had to say,” Galdieri said. “If he were to run in the Democratic primary … [and]  if Hilary Clinton is a candidate in 2016, there is definitely an opening for a candidate to the left of her,” the professor added.  He also thought that “Sanders would be much more willing to just put it all out there, go ahead with his very progressive economic message and let the chips fall where they may.”   House Budget: Help the Greedy, Not the Needy: Sen. Sanders said a budget that House Republicans passed last Thursday would give more tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations while demanding cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. Speaking about a “Freedom Summit” staged last Saturday by the Koch brothers in Manchester, N.H., Sanders said “their definition of freedom is, if you are 70 years of age and you are poor, and you have no health insurance, you’re going to have the freedom, literally, to die, because they don’t believe in keeping Medicare strong,” according to a Fox News webpage.   Progressive Budget: Cut Defense, Make Rich Pay Fair Share: Rather than cutting social programs, as House Republicans voted to do, a proposed Congressional Progressive Caucus budget would cut defense spending and raise revenue by increasing taxes on capital gains and incomes above $250,000. Sen. Sanders is the Senate’s sole member of the progressive group, The (Madison, Wis.) Capital Times noted.   Report: Tax Havens Cost Taxpayers Billions: Approximately $184 billion is lost annually in federal and state taxes to tax havens, The Washington Post online reported. Corporate tax avoidance costs an individual taxpayer anywhere from $630 to $2783, depending on the state. Vermonters are forced to pay $995 extra to make up for the lost revenue.

Here is the full-length video of Sen. Sanders' speech at Saint Anselm College's New Hampshire Institute of Politics: http://youtu.be/nfu3yafD1TQ
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  'A Fair Shake' for Working Families: Congress should expand opportunities for working Americans. "The American people want to see the middle class of this country grow," Sanders said. "They don’t want to see more tax breaks for the very, very wealthy. They want to see the ordinary folks of this country starting to get a fair shake," Sen. Bernie Sanders said Monday in a radio interview on The Ed Schultz Show. Republicans proposing tax cuts for the wealthy and cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are espousing “the agenda of the Koch Brothers,” Sanders told Schultz Monday on MSNBC.   Sanders’ Message Resonates: “Sanders could excite a popular movement strong enough to force centrist candidates to veer leftward, the way that right-wing candidates pulled Mitt Romney to the right,” the Rutland Herald and Times Argus said in an editorial. “Sanders understands that the public good requires that the forces in any system tending toward oligarchy require constant resistance if their grasp for power is to be restrained. It is a message that, increasingly, resonates around the nation.”   Ukraine’s President Calls for UN Troops: With pro-Russian militants attacking more buildings in eastern Ukraine Monday and ignoring a government deadline to disperse, Ukraine’s acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said he would welcome United Nations peacekeepers to help establish order by conducting a “joint counterterrorist operation” with Ukrainian forces, The Washington Post reported.   Political Rifts Slow U.S. Effort on Climate Laws: The United States needs to enact a major climate change law, such as a tax on carbon pollution, by the end of this decade to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of global warming, according to the authors of a report released this week by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But aggressive efforts to tackle climate change have repeatedly collided with political reality in Washington, where some Republicans question the underlying science of global warming and lawmakers’ ties to the fossil fuel industry have made them resistant to change, according to The New York Times.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  Sanders Packs  the House in New Hampshire: Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke before a packed house on Saturday at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College. If he runs for president, “he might tap into an anger fueled by the excesses of Wall Street and the corrupting influence of money in politics,” the Nashua Telegraph said in an editorial published on Monday. “A Sanders candidacy is intriguing, if only because it doesn’t seem like much of a reach to say that he is the most blunt-spoken member of Congress.”  The Country Needs Bernie: “You don't have to believe in any of Sanders' many nostrums - and I, for one, don't - to think that it would make for better politics and a great show to have him take on Ms. Clinton and make her take a stand for something other than her own excellence and destiny … Get after it Bernie. The country needs you,” Geoffrey Norman, the author and former editor of Esquire magazine wrote in The Caledonian-Record.    Sanders Listening to Americans: “I will go around the country and see if there is an appetite for us to address in a serious way the collapse of the American middle class and the growth of income and wealth and equality and millions of people working longer hours at lower wages while the wealthy are doing phenomenal well,” Sanders said in an interview broadcast Sunday on WMUR-TV in Manchester, N.H.   From the Extreme to the Mainstream: Billionaire industrialist David Koch was the Libertarian Party candidate for vice president in 1980. The party platform called for the abolition of income taxes, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the EPA and the minimum wage – and received 1 percent of the vote. Today, Koch and his billionaire brother, Charles, are financing Republican Party candidates who have moved in their direction. The extreme has become the mainstream for today’s right-wing Republicans, Sen. Sanders said in remarks broadcast Sunday on C-SPAN.

Sanders at St. Anselm:   Appearing at a town meeting this weekend in Manchester, N.H., the longest-serving independent in the history of Congress discussed the collapsing American middle class and the growing gap in wealth and income in the United States. There was an overflow crowd. At the same time Sanders was speaking at St. Anselm College, the Koch brothers and Citizens United hosted a “Freedom Summit” across town. The contrast was remarkable.

Bernie Sanders “drew a big crowd to the New Hampshire Institute of politics on Saturday,” WMUR-TV in Manchester, N.H. reported. The longest-serving independent in Congress is weighing a bid for 2016. He said the middle class is disappearing and poverty is up. He also had strong words on health care. WMUR’s Josh McElveen’s interview with Sanders is to air Sunday on “Close Up.”   Health Care for All: Speaking at St. Anselm College, the two-term senator from Vermont called it "profoundly wrong" that the United States is the only major country that does not guarantee health care coverage as a right of citizenship, The Associated Press reported.  Wealth and Income Inequality: Sen. Sanders touched on the widening wealth and income gap in the United States, national security and climate change. But he warned that a growing number of Americans are losing faith in the political system, Reuters reported.  Audience Gives Sanders a Warm Reception: The 200-plus  listeners who filled the auditorium voiced their enthusiasm by giving him a standing ovation before he spoke. He had to feel pleased with the first comment from the audience. “If you could give this address in every home in America,” a middle-aged man declared, “I think you'd be elected president.” Sanders, 72, did not rely on notes as he segued smoothly from topic to topic. The audience was on its feet again at the conclusion of the 70-minute talk, Seven Days reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/041314

Bernie Sanders is speaking Saturday at St. Anselm’s College in Manchester, N.H., about issues facing the middle class and the gaping wealth and income gap in the United States, The Boston Globe and The Nation reported. Sanders said he will focus on the crisis of a shrinking middle class, a widening gap between the rich and poor in America, college affordability, climate change and more. “Progressives are hungry for somebody who’s willing to fight on these issues,” said Ilya Sheyman, executive director of the political action committee for MoveOn.org, one of the largest liberal political groups.  Democracy vs. Oligarchy: Sen. Sanders decried the growing power of the country's economic elites in a Senate floor speech this week, The Raw Story reported. “I do not believe democracy is about a handful of billionaires, such as the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson, being in a position in which they can spend as much money as they want on any political race in this country,” Sanders said. “It is very hard for me to imagine how anybody could defend that as being democracy. It is not. It is oligarchy.”  House Passes ‘Vulgar and Obscene’ Budget: House Republicans this week passed a budget  from Rep. Paul Ryan that would give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and big corporations while cutting vital programs for working Americans, seniors and students. Sen. Sanders called the budget "vulgar and obscene," PoliticusUSA and Real Clear Politics reported.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/041214
The Week in Review:   This week more than two dozen senators joined Sen. Sanders in calling for increased funding for programs like Meals on Wheels in order to keep up with the increasing needs of our country’s growing elderly population.  The Senate passed legislation that would restore assistance for more than 2.7 million jobless workers, including about 1,832 Vermonters, who have been out of work for more than 26 weeks and had their benefits cut off late last year. Senate Republicans blocked a bill on Wednesday that would ensure women receive equal pay for equal work. Nationwide, women earn approximately 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. On Thursday House Republicans passed a budget proposal that Sen. Sanders called “vulgar and obscene” in an interview with MSNBC’s Rev. Al Sharpton.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  House Passes ‘Vulgar and Obscene’ Budget: House Republicans on Thursday passed a budget that would shower tax breaks on the wealthy and cut income tax rates on corporations while cutting support for seniors on Medicare and Social Security, families on Medicaid, children and seniors who rely on food stamps and college students struggling to afford tuition. In an interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders called the budget “vulgar and obscene.”   High Court Ruling a Bonanza for Republicans: The Republican Party and the financial industry are primed to take advantage of the Supreme Court’s ruling that ended longstanding total limits on campaign contributions. According to a review of Federal Election Commission records, more than 71 percent of big-money donors give to Republicans and less than 26 percent to Democrats. Wall Street financiers are the biggest class of uber-wealthy donors. "We are rapidly on the road to oligarchy both economically and politically," Sen. Sanders told The Huffington Post. "A smaller and smaller number of very wealthy people now have more influence than ever before thanks to Citizens United and McCutcheon."   David Koch’s Radical Manifesto: In 1980, David Koch ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket. According to information provided by Sen. Sanders' press office on Thursday, the platform consisted of dozens of odious positions from abolishing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to getting rid of campaign funding limits, according to a Daily Kos post. David and Charles Koch today are among the richest billionaires in the world and the biggest benefactors of Republican candidates and causes.   Veterans Award for Sanders: Sen. Sanders was presented with the Col. Arthur T. Marix Congressional Leadership Award by the Military Officers Association of America during a ceremony this week on Capitol Hill. General John Tilelli, Jr., presented Sanders with the award for his strong support of the uniformed services community. Sanders is chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the author of the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014, according to the Brattleboro Reformer website.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  U.S. Primary Health Care Crisis: Sen. Bernie Sanders chaired a Senate hearing on Wednesday into why one in five Americans – 60 million people – live in areas with too few primary care doctors. “What I hope we’ll get,” Sanders said at the outset of the hearing, “is some good discussion on how it happens that the United States of America ends up spending almost twice as much per person on health care and yet our end results, our health care outcomes, are not particularly good.” At the same hearing, Stan Brock, described why thousands of people wait in long lines for free care at pop-up clinics his group stages. “Some of the sick that we see here in the U.S. have nowhere to turn,” Brock said on WFFF-TV and WVYN-TV.   Veterans: Sens. Sanders and David Vitter sparred Wednesday over legislation to help veterans. Vitter wants to pass a bill to authorize two veterans' health clinics in Louisiana. So does Sanders, but the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee said Vitter should help find the three Republican votes needed to pass a more comprehensive bill for veterans that includes funding for the clinics. “If you think it's too expensive, then don't send them off to war,” Sanders said in his verbal joust with Vitter, according to The New Orleans Times-Picayune.   Republicans Block Equal Pay for Women: Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked legislation meant to close the pay gap between men and women. The vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act was strictly along party lines, with all Democrats and independent Sens. Sanders and Angus King voting in favor, MSNBC and The Huffington Post reported.   Sanders: US Headed toward Oligarchy: Sen. Sanders denounced would-be-plutocrats who are shoveling money into the political process, The Hill reported. "I do not believe democracy is about a handful of billionaires, such as the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson, being in a position where they can spend as much money as they want on any political race in this country," Sanders said in a Senate floor speech. "That’s not democracy … it is oligarchy."   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/041014

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Focuses on Middle Class: Sen. Bernie Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press and USA Today online that if he runs for president he will focus on “why the middle class is disappearing, why we are the only country in the industrialized world not to have health care for all people and yet we spend so much more per capita than other countries. What are we doing about climate change?”  Sanders will visit the Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., on Saturday for a town hall meeting on the economy and preserving America’s middle class, WCAX-TV, WMUR-TV in Manchester, N.H., The Associated Press reported.  Primary Care Crisis: Sen. Sanders is holding a hearing today on what he calls the health care access crisis in America. His point is to highlight doctor shortages and opportunities to increase the number of providers around the country. Witnesses will testify about the need for improved access to primary care for the thousands of Americans who line up at free pop-up clinics around the country, many times camping out for days to receive basic health services from volunteer providers, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.   House Considers Billionaire-Friendly Budget: The House on Thursday is set to vote on a billionaire-friendly budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman. “[T]he issue is not more tax breaks for corporations or the wealthy,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday in a radio interview on The Ed Shultz Show. “The issue is a very simple issue: do we turn our backs on fellow Americans who are hurting or do we support those families? And I think the answer is pretty clear to the American people what we should do.”  Civil Rights Law: President Obama will join former presidents at the Lyndon Baines Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas, to mark a half century since Johnson's landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act. The civil rights debate now extends to issues like attempting to establish a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 12 million undocumented people in the United States. This is unfinished business for Obama. “On civil rights, he has struggled with the immigration bill that would take 12 million people out of the shadows and give them rights they don't have,” Sen. Sanders told Reuters.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/040914 
A Ruling for the Rich and Republicans: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/a-ruling-for-the-rich
Paycheck Fairness:   The Senate on Tuesday debated a bill that would ensure women receive equal pay for equal work. Nationwide, women earn approximately 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. In Vermont, women make 85 percent of what Vermont men make. No state does better, according to the American Association of University Women.  “We are proud that Vermont is No. 1 among the states, but we can do better in Vermont and we certainly can do better as a nation,” Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a joint statement.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/paycheck-fairness

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Health Care Success is a Republican ‘Nightmare’: A new poll found the number of uninsured Americans has fallen to the lowest level since 2008. Sen. Bernie Sanders attributed that result to the successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act. “As millions of people begin to get affordable health care, as the Medicaid program expands and people who never had health insurance in their lives finally are able to go into a doctor – for the Republicans this is a nightmare,” the senator said during an MSNBC interview Monday on The Ed Show.   Help for Long-Term Unemployed Passes Senate: The Senate passed a measure on Monday that would restore federal funding for extended unemployment benefits for 2.8 million Americans who are considered long-term unemployed. “We`re going to put money into the hands of people who need it and will spend it,” Sen. Sanders said during an interview on MSNBC. The measure is one plank in what Democrats call their fairness agenda, which also includes a measure to promote equal pay for women, up for a vote likely on Wednesday, and another to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.   Help for Seniors Proposed by Sanders: Americans are living longer which means programs for the elderly need more money, according to Sen. Sanders and more than two dozen colleagues. Sanders is the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on aging. He and his colleagues want at least a 12 percent increase in funding for Older Americans Act programs like Meals on Wheels. The money would be used to meet existing demand, address rising costs and respond to the growth in the number of seniors in the United States, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported. Sen. Patrick Leahy is also a supporter.   Help Veterans go to College: Sen. Sanders legislation to increase funding for veterans’ higher education benefits was endorsed by Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida. The Republican congressman told WFLA-AM in Tampa, Fla., that he supports the bill by the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee to give in-state tuition rates to veterans who qualify under the GI Bill. The congressman urged listeners to contact Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson and urge them to support the bill.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/040814
'Their Nightmare'  With more than 7 million Americans signing up for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, critics who predicted its collapse are instead dealing with “their worst nightmare,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Monday.  “First, the United States remains the only country in the industrialized world that doesn’t guarantee health care to all of its people as a right. Second of all, the Republicans have opposed the Affordable Care Act from day one – it is their nightmare that it succeeds. Thirdly these are the same guys that want to end Medicare as we know it, convert it into a voucher program, who want to make massive cuts in Medicaid, who had eight years under Bush to do something – even a little thing – about health care, they did nothing. So these guys have nothing at all to say. And their nightmare is as millions of people begin to get affordable health care, as the Medicaid program expands and people who never had health insurance in their lives finally are able to go into a doctor – for the Republicans this is a nightmare. Imagine that the United States government does something for ordinary people and not just for billionaires – what kind of nightmare is that? That is their fear, Ed,” Sanders said in an interview with Ed Schultz on MSNBC.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Set to Pass Bill Extending Jobless Aid: The Senate is expected to easily approve legislation Monday restoring unemployment benefits to nearly three million people, throwing the bill to a divided House. Seven House Republicans from high-unemployment regions or swing districts plan to send House Speaker John Boehner a letter to urge him to take up the Senate bill or a similar measure. Other House Republicans are pressing to attach to the Senate bill what they call job-creation measures: building the transcontinental Keystone XL pipeline; consolidating job training programs; or raising employer-mandated health care coverage to employees who work 40 hours a week, rather than 30, as written in President Obama’s health care law.  The ‘Corporate 5’: The Supreme Court by a vote of 5-4 struck down aggregate limits on how much individuals can give directly to federal candidates and political party committees. The decision continues the money equals speech theme championed in the Corporate Five’s 2010 decision in Citizens United, which opened the door for corporate money to flood into Super PACs ... Progressive champion Sanders blasted the latest ruling. “Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government,” according to Daily Kos.  Cities Fighting Income Inequality: The Seattle City Council is debating a plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour — forging ahead on its plan to tackle income inequality as efforts in the nation’s capital have languished.  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has run into obstacles at the state level to tax the rich more to pay for programs aimed at the poor. Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles are also considering proposals to tackle inequality, such as bolstering programs for public education, transportation, affordable housing and wages. This patchwork effort comes as the fortunes of the haves have diverged even more from those of the have-nots across the country. The top 1 percent of households has captured about 95 percent of the income gains eked out during the tepid recovery from the Great Recession, The New York Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Vermont a Leader on Health Care: The Vermont Progressive Party spent years building support for health care reform and nudging the state’s Democrats. Gov. Peter Shumlin three years ago signed a bill creating a single-payer system, according to a column in Sunday’s New York Times. "Americans want to see a model that works," Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Atlantic in December. "If Vermont can be that model it will have a profound impact on discourse in this country."  The Koch Brothers: “The Koch brothers could spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to elect right-wing candidates,” Sen. Sanders said in a speech that MSNBC Lawrence O’Donnell cited on Friday night to set up a discussion about a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Charles Koch on why he and his brother David are pouring so much money into right wing political causes and candidates. "I`m fighting to restore a free society,” Charles Koch wrote. “Instead of welcoming free debate, collectivists engage in character assassination."  Afghan Turnout Is High as Voters Defy the Taliban Title: Defying a campaign of Taliban violence that unleashed 39 suicide bombers in the two months before Election Day, Afghan voters on Saturday turned out in such high numbers to choose a new president and provincial councils that polling hours were extended nationwide, in a triumph of determination over intimidation. Militants failed to mount a single major attack anywhere in Afghanistan by the time polls closed, and voters lined up despite heavy rain and cold in the capital and elsewhere, The New York Times reported.  Obama to Order Workplace Rules: Lacking congressional backing to raise wages or end gender pay disparities, President Barack Obama this week will sign an executive order that would prohibit federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their pay with each other. The prohibition is similar to language in a Senate bill aimed at closing a pay gap between men and women. That legislation is scheduled for a vote this week, though it is not likely to pass. In addition, Obama on Tuesday will direct the Labor Department to adopt regulations requiring federal contractors to provide compensation data based on sex and race, The Associated Press reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Expected to Pass Unemployment Bill: The Senate is expected to pass legislation on Monday that would restore long-term unemployment benefits that were allowed to expire in December, but the bill may be dead-on-arrival in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. “This is something that is desperately needed from a moral point of view. What we also know economically is that when you put money in the hands of people who are going to spend it, it creates jobs,” Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. “So this is a twofer.”    Sanders: Court Decision ‘Dead Wrong’: The Supreme Court removed the cap on the total amount of money donors can contribute to candidates and parties in each election. "They are dead wrong," Sen. Sanders said in an interview broadcast Friday on Vermont Public Radio. “The court decision “is freedom for a handful of the wealthiest people in this country to undermine American democracy and to buy elections,” lamented Sanders in Sunday editions of The New York Times. On The Thom Hartmann Program, Sanders called for a grassroots movement to pass a constitutional amendment that would overturn the ruling and others like it. “[W]e need our ordinary citizens to be extraordinary citizens.”  Rich Republicans Unshackled: Sen. Sanders hit the nail on the head this week when he said, “Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government,” Angelo Lynn wrote in an Addison County Independent editorial. Sanders told Amy Goodman Wednesday's McCutcheon decision grants "freedom for a handful of the wealthiest people in this country to undermine American democracy and to buy elections," Truthout and Truthdig reported.  In a letter to The Union of Grass Valley, Calif., Michelle Spencer quoted Sanders saying "a handful of self-serving right-wing billionaires have the capability of spending more money on the political process than everyone else combined." From the right, National Review ranked a Sanders speech on the ruling the top "outburst" of “left-wing.”  Broadband in Vermont: Colleges, public libraries, health care providers and schools are among more than 400 community institutions throughout rural Vermont that now have fiber-optic broadband connections. Two Vermont companies won federal economic stimulus grants to complete the project. Students and teachers are among the Vermonters who are benefiting. "Vermont may be on the verge of reaping enormous dividends from this historic investment in our future," Sen. Sanders said in Saturday’s Bennington Banner. "The ultra-fast Internet offers the chance to dramatically change how we think about education, health care and business."

The Week in Review:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday handed the wealthy more power to spend more money and have more influence on who wins elections. After a very rocky rollout, there were very impressive results by a midnight Monday deadline when more than 7 million Americans signed up for health care under the Affordable Care Act. The March jobs report issued Friday by the Labor Department showed the number of Americans out of work six months or more is twice as high as before the recession began in 2007. The latest jobless numbers bolster the case for Congress to extend benefits that expired late last for the long-term unemployed.  Continue reading: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-040414
Real Unemployment at 12.7%:  The official unemployment rate for March was 6.7 percent, unchanged from February, but real unemployment ticked up to 12.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. That number counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and those unemployed for so long that they have given up looking for work. The Senate is expected to vote Monday to resurrect benefits that expired last Dec. 28 for the long-term jobless. “This will impact several million American workers who are at the end of their ropes financially,” Sanders said. Passing the bill is “the morally right thing to do” and “good economics,” the senator added, but he cautioned that the measure faces an uncertain fate in the Republican-run House.  This bill to extend long-term emergency unemployment benefits for 2.2 million Americans would restore benefits that expired nearly three months ago.The benefits, about $300 a week on average, help jobless workers fill up their gas tank to get to a job interview, feed their families, pay the rent and heat their homes.  Each  week that the Congress fails to act, an additional 72,000 Americans are losing their unemployment benefits. Today, about 4 million Americans who are currently looking for a job have been unemployed for more than 6 months. In the wake of a slow recovery from the recession that began in 2007, long-term unemployment is near a 60-year high.  House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans today oppose extending the benefits, but when George W. Bush was President, Republicans, including Boehner, voted for emergency unemployment benefits five times  Now that Barack Obama is in the White House, many congressional Republicans oppose extending these benefits. Since 1958, Congress has never failed to pass emergency unemployment benefits when long-term unemployment has been as high as it is today. Today, there are nearly three job applicants for every one job opening.  There simply aren’t enough jobs out there for the more than 10 million Americans who are actively seeking work.  The long-term unemployment rate today is more than double what it’s been at any other time Congress has let emergency jobless assistance expire. For example, hundreds of people applied last month to work at a Sam’s Club in Oxford, Ala., that won’t be opening until August. In January, more than 5,000 people waited in line for just 1,500 jobs at an outlet mall in Palm Beach, Fla. That same month, 1,600 people in Hagerstown, Md., applied for just 36 job openings at a dairy farm to process milk and ice cream. Last December, 10,000 people applied for just 750 flight attendant jobs at Southwest Airlines and more than 23,000 Americans applied for just 600 jobs at Wal-Mart in Washington, DC.  If Congress fails to extend emergency unemployment benefits, 240,000 American workers will lose their jobs by the end of this year. The overall economy will be hurt because when people lose their unemployment benefits, they don’t go to the grocery store, they don’t buy clothes, they don’t go to the pharmacy.  Businesses lose customers, they lose money, and they fire even more people.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  March Unemployment Rose to 12.7%: Real unemployment in March ticked up to 12.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday. That number counts workers forced to settle for part-time jobs and those unemployed for so long that they have given up looking for work. The 6.7 percent official unemployment rate was unchanged from February. The Senate is expected to vote Monday to resurrect benefits that expired last Dec. 28 for the long-term jobless. “This will impact several million American workers who are at the end of their ropes financially,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Bill Press Show on Thursday. He said passing the bill is “the morally right thing to do” and “good economics,” but he cautioned that the measure faces an uncertain fate in the Republican-run House.  Sanders Calls for Public Funding of Campaigns: This week’s Supreme Court decision and earlier rulings striking down laws that limited campaign donations are a “terrible disservice to the American people,” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC on Thursday. The solution, Sanders said, is public funding of elections “so that all candidates have a fair shot at getting elected, and they can be judged by their ideas, by what they're fighting for, and not by the bank accounts of their campaign sponsors." Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment that would undo a series of court rulings and restore the power of Congress and state lawmakers to ban corporate contributions and limit individual donations, Vermont Public Radio reported.  Court Undermines Democracy: Sen. Sanders denounced the ruling from the Supreme Court’s five conservative justices that struck down individual campaign contribution limits, Slate, PoliticusUSA, The (Madison, Wis.) Capotal Times, World Net Daily, and the Baltimore Post-Examiner reported. Sanders told Democracy Now! that the ruling is "an outrage to the struggles that people have undertaken in this country for democracy.” Republicans cheered the ruling, which Sanders criticized in a series of radio interviews Thursday on The Joe Piscopo Show, The Randi Rhodes Show and The Stephanie Miller Show. The decision, Sanders said on KTRH-AM in Houston, Texas and WHIO-AM in Dayton, Ohio, would enable billionaires to “buy elections.”  Vermont Election Law Voided: Wednesday’s decision in the McCutcheon case triggered a provision invalidating in a new Vermont campaign funding law that would have limited individual donations, according to a Vt. Digger report in which Sen. Sanders called the ruling “totally absurd.”    Continue reading today's news: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/040414

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Supreme Court Rules for the Rich: Sen. Bernie Sanders denounced a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling on Wednesday that fundamentally undermines American democracy by striking down limits on total donations that individuals may make to political candidates and parties, the Burlington Free Press, Moyers & Company and London’s Daily Mail reported. “These five justices are working night and day to make the wealth and powerful more wealthy and more powerful,” Sanders told nationally syndicated radio host Leslie Marshall. We have to be careful that we do not let this great country … become a plutocracy or an oligarchy. That, frankly, is the direction that we are moving,” Sanders said in a Senate speech shown on WFFF-TV and WVYN-TV.  Democracy Now!: Sen. Sanders said the Supreme Court’s ruling only offers “freedom” to a handful of wealthy donors who can afford to dump more than $125,000 into campaigns. “For them to plop a few billion dollars into the political process,” Sen. Sanders told Amy Goodman in a Thursday morning interview for Democracy Now! “It’s just an outrage… I suspect in the next presidential campaign, the Koch brothers themselves will spend a billion dollars to elect the candidate of their choice.”  Court Commentary: The decision elicited strong disapproval from a host of Democrats and liberals. President Barack Obama, a spokesman said, was “disappointed,” and Sen. Sanders predicted that henceforth, “billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process,” according to a Chicago Tribune editorial. “Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government,” Sen. Sanders said in a Rutland Herald and Times Argus editorial. Writing for Politico, National Review editor Rich Lowry didn’t like the way “Sanders natters on about the decision creating ‘an oligarchic form of society.’”  Oligarchs and Plutocrats: An oligarchy is a system of "government by the few." Rooted in Greek, oligos means "few" and arch means "rule," as in monarch or hierarchy. Plutocracy has been used in English since the middle of the 17th century to refer to the rule or power of the wealthy. Pluto comes from the Greek for "wealth." Back in 1917, Theodore Roosevelt said government by a plutocracy is un-American. It took Sen. Sanders to roll both terms into one sentence in a speech railing against domestic spending cuts, he said: "This is not what democracy looks like. This is what oligarchy and plutocracy look like," the Christian Science Monitor reported.  Continue reading today's news: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/040314

High Court Gives Big Money More Say in Campaigns:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down overall campaign contribution limits. The law that the 5-4 ruling voided has prevented individuals from contributing more than $123,000 to candidates and party committees per election cycle. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has proposed a constitutional amendment to restore the power of Congress and state lawmakers to limit campaign donations, blasted the ruling.“Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government,” Sanders said.  The ruling gives wealthy donors like the billionaires Charles and David Koch more power to influence elections. An earlier ruling in Citizens United vs. FEC resulted in a record $7 billion being spent in the 2012 election cycle, including at least $400 million by the Koch brothers alone. “What world are the five conservative Supreme Court justices living in?” Sanders asked. “To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with ‘freedom of speech’ is totally absurd. The Supreme Court is paving the way toward an oligarchic form of society in which a handful of billionaires like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson will control our political process.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/high-court-gives-big-money-more-say-in-campaigns #McCutcheon
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obamacare Reaches Millions: President Obama declared victory Tuesday in the government’s aggressive push to enroll seven million people in private health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act. “This is a big, big deal,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a Tuesday radio interview on The Ed Shultz Show. “Ten million people today have health care who previously did not,” Sanders said. He was counting the more than 7 million enrolled through insurance exchanges plus more covered by an expansion of Medicaid. Even more Americans would be covered, Sanders added, if 23 states would accept expanded Medicaid services available under the Affordable Care Act. The coverage would come at no additional cost to the states for three years.  VA Backlog Cut: The Veterans Affairs Department cut a backlog of pending disability compensation claims by 44 percent in the past year. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders applauded the news, WTOP-AM in Washington, D.C., reported. Sanders told The Washington Post he is monitoring the progress. “We don’t want to sacrifice accuracy for speed.” Sanders has proposed a comprehensive veterans affairs bill which would require quarterly reports to Congress from the VA on efforts to eliminate the backlog by the end of 2015, the Bennington Banner reported.  Global Warming: A United Nations report on Monday affirmed that man-made warming is already here and called on countries to act immediately to curb emissions and plan for changes that are now inevitable, Environment & Energy Publishing reported. "We can no longer ignore warnings that climate change already is happening and that unless we act in a bold way, the worst is yet to come," Sen. Sanders said. Sanders urged the Senate to pass a bill he introduced last year with Sen. Barbara Boxer that would tax carbon.    Ocean Energy: Lawmakers and the progressive Center for American Progress are pushing for investments in ocean and tidal energy projects, WorldNetDaily.com reported. Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer recently proposed a “Sustainable Technologies Finance Program” seeking $500 billion for investments in “wind, solar, geothermal, advanced biomass and biofuels, ocean and tidal energy, hydropower, advanced transportation projects, and energy efficiency technologies."

A Big Deal:  There was a surge in signups for health coverage in advance of Monday’s midnight deadline to enroll under the Affordable Care Act. “Ten million people today have health care who previously did not,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz in a radio interview on Tuesday. “This is a big, big deal.” Even more Americans would be covered, Sanders said, if 23 states would accept expanded Medicaid services available under the Affordable Care Act. The coverage would come at no additional cost to the states for three years.  And even more people would be covered and get better care at less cost if the United States provided Medicare-like coverage for all Americans. Sanders hopes Vermont will show the rest of the country the advantages of universal health care like the rest of the major countries in the world.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Health Care Signup Surges: Millions of Americans logged onto the federal health insurance website in the run-up to Monday’s enrollment deadline. Even more Americans would get access to care if Republican governors would agree to expand Medicaid at no cost to their states, Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz Monday on MSNBC. Sanders said Democrats should “turn the tables” on Republicans and ask “what kind of party would deny working families” health insurance  Global Warming: Worst Still to Come: The United Nation on Monday released its most recent report on climate change. The dire message was that global warming already is having a severe impact and is projected to aggravate poverty, particularly in urban areas and emerging hot spots of hunger. “The debate really is over,” Sen. Sanders was quoted in a Brattleboro Reformer editorial. “We can no longer ignore warnings that climate change already is happening and that unless we act in a bold way the worst is yet to come.” Sanders called the report a wake-up call. He has introduced legislation to tax the carbon and methane emissions that cause global warming, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.  U.S. and Canada Border Crossing Backups: Two of Vermont’s traffic-choked border crossings – Derby Line and Highgate Springs – are among ports of entry across the country that will get additional border patrol officers by the fall of 2015. Long lines at Vermont’s land-border ports of entry, exacerbated by a staffing shortage, have frustrated travelers and hurt Vermont businesses. “We’re pleased that Customs and Border Protection is addressing a very serious problem,” Sen. Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press. “If we’re going to move traffic across the border at reasonable speeds and protect the nation, we need adequate staffing.”  Democracy vs. Oligarchy: Wealthy elites bankrolling right-wing Republican candidates are accelerating America’s move away from democracy toward oligarchy, Sen. Sanders wrote for The Huffington Post. “Clearly, if we are to retain the fundamentals of American democracy, we need to overturn the Supreme Court decision,” Sanders said, adding that the nation “must move toward public funding of elections.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/040114
The great political struggle we now face is whether the United States retains its democratic heritage or whether we move toward an oligarchic form of society where the real political power rests with a handful of billionaires, not ordinary Americans.
U.N. Warning on Climate Change:
 
 There was another jolting wake-up call issued on Monday by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report said the effects of global warming already are occurring on every continent and across the world’s oceans. The scientists warned that the problem was likely to grow much worse unless greenhouse gas emissions are brought under control. Polar ice caps are melting, sea ice in the Arctic is collapsing, heat waves and flooding are becoming more intense, some animals already have become extinct and coral reefs are dying, according to the latest report from the panel of experts that periodically summarizes climate science. The report also warned that climate change can increase risks of civil war and other violent clashes by amplifying forces like poverty and economic shocks that drive such conflicts.  “The time is late. We can no longer ignore warnings that climate change already is happening and that unless we act in a bold way the worst is yet to come,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate environment and energy committees.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Affordable Care Act Hits Critical Deadline: The first enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act ends at midnight Monday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the rollout was awful for what remains a worthwhile program that will help a lot of people who need health insurance. “We heard the other day about a woman whose kid has diabetes. She was rejected 34 times before the ACA in terms of being able to get insurance for her kid. That is just crazy stuff. That's gone,” Sanders told WPTZ-TV.  Ukraine Crisis: Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart on Sunday discussed ways to de-escalate the crisis over Ukraine’s future and Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Sen. Sanders said in an interview broadcast Sunday on WCAX-TV that the United States must prevent war. He credited the Obama administration for working within the G-7 to organize severe sanctions against Russia, which  has more than 40,000 troops massed near Ukraine’s border.  ‘Inequality for All’: Sen. Sanders on Sunday hosted a free screening of the documentary “Inequality for All” and an interactive town meeting discussion on the topic of income inequality. The documentary, which debuted at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, was shown at locations in Bennington, Brattleboro, Middlebury, and St. Johnsbury, the Bennington Banner, Rutland Herald, Times Argus, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported. “We have got to put people back to work.  Climate Change: Worst Is Yet to Come Climate: change is already having sweeping effects and the problem is likely to grow substantially worse unless greenhouse emissions are brought under control, scientists reported Monday. The United Nations group that periodically summarizes climate science concluded that ice caps are melting, sea ice in the Arctic is collapsing, water supplies are coming under stress, heat waves and heavy rains are intensifying, coral reefs are dying, and fish and many other creatures are migrating toward the poles or in some cases going extinct, according to The New York Times.
Must Read: The New Billionaire Political Bosses - Robert Reich, The Huffington Post
 
 Charles and David Koch should not be blamed for having more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans put together. Nor should they be condemned for their petrochemical empire. As far as I know, they've played by the rules and obeyed the laws.
 
 They're also entitled to their own right-wing political views. It's a free country.
 
 But in using their vast wealth to change those rules and laws in order to fit their political views, the Koch brothers are undermining our democracy. That's a betrayal of the most precious thing Americans share...
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Republicans Try to Disenfranchise Voters in Key States: Pivotal swing states under Republican control are embracing significant new electoral restrictions on registering and voting that go beyond the voter identification requirements that have caused fierce partisan brawls. The bills, laws and administrative rules — some of them tried before — shake up fundamental components of state election systems, including the days and times polls are open and the locations where people vote, The New York Times reported.  Raise the Minimum Wage: As other states debate raising the minimum wage, one of Vermont's U.S. senators supports the idea of raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10. Sen. Bernie Sanders talked with WCAX-TV’s capital bureau chief Kyle Midura and Seven Days' Paul Heintz on “You Can Quote Me.” Sanders is cosponsor of the legislation that the U.S. Senate could take up this week.  Inequality for All: It's the first time Senator Bernie Sanders will ever hold four town meetings at once, and it's happening today in Middlebury, Brattleboro, St. Johnsbury, and Bennington, WCAX-TV reported. Sanders will host free screenings of the Robert Reich documentary “Inequality for All” on income and wealth inequality, a topic, close to Sanders' heart, WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV reported.  U.S., Russia to Meet on Ukraine: Secretary of State John Kerry is in Paris preparing to meet his Russian counterpart in another bid to calm tensions and resolve the crisis over Ukraine. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are meeting later Sunday. They'll sit down at the residence of the Russian ambassador to France to go over Moscow's response to a U.S. plan to de-escalate the situation as Russian troops continue to mass along the Ukrainian border, The Associated Press reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The Sheldon Primary: Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke out on Friday about the “Sheldon primary,” a gathering of Republican presidential candidates auditioning for the backing of billionaire Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson. Sanders said wealthy donors like Adelson and the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch “have unlimited sums of money and they can now use that money on the electoral process, which means never-ending negative ads, it means setting up all kinds of phony think tanks, and other types of organizations.” Sanders said on The Thom Hartmann Program.  The Billionaire Party: In a Senate floor speech on this week, Sen. Sanders said political power is no longer divided between the Republicans and Democrats. Instead, a billionaire party bankrolls candidates, Truthdig reported.  Inequality for All: Income and wealth inequality in America will be the focus of town meetings hosted by Sen. Sanders on Sunday at Middlebury, Brattleboro, St. Johnsbury and Bennington. He will show the Robert Reich documentary, “Inequality for All,”  WFFF-TV reported. “What's going on is about 95 percent of all of the new income generated in this country goes to the top 1 percent and the gap between the very, very rich and everybody else is growing wider,” the senator told WCAX-TV.  “We have more people living in poverty than ever before,” Sanders told WPTZ-TV on Friday.   Roses for Sanders: A Bennington Banner editorial praised Sen. Sanders for addressing the issue of income equality in Vermont and listed the locations of the four town meetings on Sunday. "If tens of millions of people don’t have disposable income, how can they be expected to purchase products that will keep corporations in business and grow the economy?" asked Sanders during an interview with the Banner earlier this week.
The Week in Review:  The Senate put the parliamentary gears in motion for votes on raising the minimum wage and restoring long-term unemployment benefits. A Senate hearing on Thursday looked at why road construction projects and the jobs they generate are in jeopardy this construction season. After a rocky rollout, there was a surge in signups for Obamacare. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the United States should join major countries in the rest of the world that offer less expensive more effective universal health care. In a Senate floor speech on Thursday, Sanders spoke out against the rising political power of the wealthy in America.
As the longest serving independent in the history of the U.S. Congress I want to address an issue that I think does not get the kind of discussion that it should from either political party...   Watch the speech here: http://youtu.be/fQOCfweYLrE
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Inequality for All: Income and wealth inequality in America will be the focus of town meetings hosted by Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday at Middlebury, Brattleboro, St. Johnsbury and Bennington. He will show the Robert Reich documentary, “Inequality for All,” The Addison County Independent, WPTZ-TV, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.  Sanders called wealth and income inequality “the great moral, economic and political issue of our time,” in columns published on Friday in the Brattleboro Reformer, Bennington Banner and The Caledonian-Record.   Rule by the Rich: In a Senate floor speech on Thursday, Sen. Sanders spoke out against the rise of the wealthy in United States politics. “We have a nation in which the economics and politics are controlled by a handful of billionaire families, [where] it doesn't matter what party is in power because the real power rests with a billionaire class,” he said. The Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, Sanders argued, “allows the super wealthy to spend as much as they want on elections,” meaning that the “billionaire party is now in fact the major political force in this country ... led by people like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson,” The Huffington Post reported.  Health Care: Universal health care systems cost less and provide better care than the private insurance system in the United States, Sen. Sanders told Ronan Farrow Thursday on MSNBC. “I think we need to get the profit motive out of health care. We need to guarantee health care to all people as a right. We need to do it in cost-effective way,” Sanders said. He hopes Vermont “will lead the nation in showing what a single-payer system can do."   Highway Funds in Jeopardy: Vermont Agency of Transportation Deputy Secretary Sue Minter says the possible shortfall in federal transportation funding could hurt jobs in Vermont. Minter testified Thursday before a U.S. Senate committee at the invitation of Sen. Sanders. His office said projects may be cancelled unless Congress replenishes the federal Highway Trust Fund, which is projected to run out by July, The Associated Press, the Burlington Free Press reported.

Road Projects in Jeopardy:   A Senate panel was warned on Thursday that a looming shortfall in federal transportation funding could cancel construction projects this summer and put people out of work. “Reducing or eliminating transportation projects translates into job losses in the construction industry,” Vermont Agency of Transportation Deputy Secretary Sue Minter told the Senate public works committee. “In a small state like ours, this can tip the balance on our fragile economic recovery.” Sen. Bernie Sanders invited the Vermont official to testify about the need to shore up the Highway Trust Fund, which relies almost entirely on gasoline taxes.

Sunday: Join Sen. Bernie Sanders for a free showing of the film "Inequality for All" featuring former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Hypocritical House Republicans to Block Jobless Benefits: The Senate plans to vote today or tomorrow on extending long-term jobless benefits, but a compromise package may be dead-on-arrival in the Republican-controlled House. “When Bush was president, Republicans, including John Boehner, voted for emergency unemployment benefits five times without paying for them,” Sen. Bernie Sanders noted on The Ed Schultz Show. “That’s the hypocrisy.”  Food Stamps Cuts: Sen. Sanders called Republican efforts to deepen cuts to food stamp programs an “ugly moment in American history,” The Huffington Post, Daily Kos, and PJ Media reported. "What you’re looking at is an ugly kind of class warfare where the people on top want more and more and more. And they’re pushing down in an incredibly terrible way the most vulnerable people in our country," Sanders said.   Inequality for All: Sen. Sanders on Sunday will host four simultaneous town meeting discussions about income and wealth inequality. Audiences in Bennington, Brattleboro, Middlebury and St. Johnsbury will watch the documentary “Inequality for All,” featuring former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich, then join for a video conference discussion led by Sanders who will be at Middlebury Union High School, The Associated Press and the Rutland Herald reported.   Dental Care: Retired health professionals endorsed legislation from Sen. Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings that would expand access to dental care. A letter to the editor of The Baltimore Sun said the bill would require health insurance companies to cover dental care under the Affordable Care Act.

Two Ways to Fix Inequality - Judith Levine, Seven Days:  Working people can't afford to eat. Last year one in five Americans was on food stamps. In Vermont, the number was one in six. These people work: Six in 10 households nationally earned money the month they started getting help; nine in 10 worked in the previous or following year.  People earning the minimum wage can't afford to eat if they also want to live indoors. With heat.  At Vermont's 2013 minimum wage, $8.46 an hour (it's now $8.73), two full-time, year-round job holders bring in a total of about $2,900 a month. According to Hunger Free Vermont's analysis, based on the basic-needs budget of the Vermont Legislative Joint Fiscal Office (JFO), their bills leave them a deficit of about $2,100 each month.

The Long-Term Jobless: 
 
 The Senate is poised to vote next week on a bill that would  provide retroactive unemployment benefits for more than 2 million Americans who have been out of work the longest. The benefit checks were cut off last Dec. 28 when the federal program expired. “It’s a moral issue and it’s an economic issue,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz on Wednesday. States provide unemployment benefits  for 26 weeks. In the past, emergency federal benefits -- $287 a week on average -- have kicked in for up to 47 additional weeks. When the emergency program lapsed late last year, 1.3 million people lost those benefits. Since then, about 72,000 people a week have had benefits cut off.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Stop Spying on Americans: President Barack Obama announced plans to reform the National Security Agency’s controversial phone records program by requiring private phone companies to hold the data instead of the federal government. Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC the proposal is a “step forward,” but he also said the president must do more to ensure Americans’ constitutional privacy rights. “In my view, you're not a free country when the federal government collects every phone call made in this country, when the federal government gets into some of our emails, the websites we visit, and has the capability of going to the library and knowing the books you took out,” Sanders said. “That is not what freedom is about.”   Food Stamps: Sen. Sanders called a proposal to cut food stamp programs a “very ugly moment” for America, OpEdNews reported. “What kind of nation are we when we give tax breaks to millionaires but we can’t take care of the elderly and the children?” Sanders asked.   NSA Reforms: President Barack Obama and House Intelligence Committee lawmakers are calling for an overhaul of the National Security Agency's phone-records program requiring searches to be conducted by private phone companies rather than compiling records at the agency, The Wall Street Journal reported. The proposals from the Obama administration and the House Intelligence Committee are strikingly similar, except the White House would prefer to have a judge approve each data search before as opposed to after the fact, officials said.   Billionaire Adelson Plans 2016 Republican Push: Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson is planning a major financial push to help a mainstream Republican with broad appeal win the presidential election in 2016, according to The Washington Post. Adelson and his wife poured more than $92 million into the 2012 White House race.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/032614
Spying on Americans:   President Barack Obama is crafting legislation that would stop the National Security Agency from collecting records on millions of Americans’ telephone calls. Instead, phone companies would store the records. Law enforcement officials would have to convince a judge that there is a specific reason to search the records. Meanwhile, however, the administration asked a special court that operates in secret for a 90-day extension of the NSA’s authorization to conduct the bulk collection. “The president should end that program now, not 90 days from now,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday. He discussed it with Ed Schultz on MSNBC.  Watch the video: http://youtu.be/P7zUlatc5ZA

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Republicans Want Harsher Food Stamp Cuts: Republicans plan to unveil a new budget plan with even deeper cuts to programs which help provide food mostly for children, the elderly and disabled persons. Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC on Monday the proposal marked a “very ugly moment” in America. “What kind of nation are we when we give tax breaks to millionaires but we can’t take care of the elderly and the children?” Sanders asked.   Income Inequality: Sen. Sanders will host town meetings this Sunday to show Robert Reich’s documentary film “Inequality for All,” which examines the widening income gap in the United States. Simultaneous events will be held in Bennington, Brattleboro, Middlebury and St. Johnsbury, the Bennington Banner reported.   Global Warming: A bill by Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer would establish a price on carbon. Energy from fossil fuels that cause global warming would be more expensive, but 60 percent the revenue raised would be refunded to families to help offset the higher prices. The remaining revenue could be invested in sustainable and renewable energy like solar power and for making buildings more energy efficient. “The only way we can address climate change and get off of oil is to give families access to alternatives. We cannot produce our way to lower prices,” Public Citizen’s Tyson Slocum told the Qatar-bankrolled Al Jazeera America.   Aid Package for Ukraine Advances in the Senate: The Senate voted on Monday to formally take up legislation to aid Ukraine and sanction Russia, beginning what promises to be a heated weeklong debate in Congress over the role the International Monetary Fund should play in the Crimean crisis. While the 78-17 vote showed considerable bipartisan support for the measure, conservatives remain opposed to an overhaul of the monetary fund’s governance structure, which would expand Ukraine’s borrowing limit at the fund but, many Republicans say, would also diminish the United States’s authority and even increase Russia’s, according to The New York Times.

A Very Ugly Moment:  “What kind of nation are we when we give tax breaks to millionaires but we can’t take care of the elderly and the children?” Sen. Bernie Sanders asked on Monday. He was reacting to a new report that more than 18  percent of Americans last year struggled to afford food. Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, are calling for deeper and deeper cuts in food stamps, a program that provides help mostly to children and seniors.  We are living in “a very ugly moment,” the senator told the Rev. Al Sharpton.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Single Payer: The Affordable Care Act is making some small strides toward ensuring coverage for everyone, but single-payer—tirelessly championed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders—would do more to level inequality and boost health outcomes, according to a blog for The Nation.   NSA Spying: Asserting that the spying powers of the U.S. government are far greater than anyone suspected, MSNBC on Sunday looked at a speech last week by Sen. Rand Paul at the University of California at Berkley, Calif. “To his credit, Rand Paul seems really sincere in his effort to create cross party consensus on national security. Interestingly, all the members he mentioned during his speech, Sens.

George Miller and Rush Holt met with Bolivian Preisdent Evo Morales this week, Bolivia.com and La Razon reported. Relations between the two countries weakened after Bolivia expelled the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in 2008. "There is a commitment from both parties to re-establish a good relationship," said Sen. Harkin. “I told [the congressmen] that we [Bolivia] don’t want to be subjugated, nor do we want to control anyone. We just want respect between nations, as states, as governments,” Morales said, according to Bolivia’s information agency.   Russia Completes Annexation of Crimea: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed legislation to complete the annexation of Crimea, The Washington Post reported.

The Week in Review:   An idea that may have started with a call by Sen. Bernie Sanders to Vermont’s governor is keeping nutrition and home heating assistance flowing to people in a growing number of states. House Speaker John Boehner was fuming on Thursday over how the idea that Sanders was the first to broach with Gov. Shumlin has foiled a Republican bid to cut food stamps. Election Day on Tuesday in Illinois saw another example of widespread public support for raising the minimum wage. Also on Tuesday, Sanders was among senators signing a letter sent to President Obama urging him to issue an executive order banning workplace discrimination against gays.

Heat and Eat: 
 
 Vermont and other states have figured out a way to help some seniors and families with children avoid freezing or starving this winter. Under a so-called “Heat and Eat” provision in the food stamps program, a household is entitled to more food aid if it also is enrolled in the federally-funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps people pay their utility bills. Some states were making only token payments to families for home heating assistance to help them qualify for food stamps. The farm bill that Congress passed in February said states would have to pay at least $20 a year in fuel aid to prompt the food stamp benefits. Republicans assumed that states wouldn’t want to pay the extra $20 and projected that the new farm bill would result in $8.6 billion in food stamp cuts over the next decade. They were wrong.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  U.S. Senators Meet Bolivia’s President: Sen. Tom Harkin spoke to reporters at the presidential palace after a meeting Thursday with President Evo Morales in La Paz, Bolivia. Sen.

VA Budget: Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki outlined President Obama’s budget for veterans programs before a hearing of the Senate veterans affairs committee chaired by Sen. Sanders. Obama wants a 6.5 percent increase in spending from last year, The New York Times reported online. Sanders probed Shinseki and his undersecretary for health, Dr. Robert Petzel, on the department’s ability to respond to the fast-growing need for mental health services.   LGBT: Discrimination Nearly 200 lawmakers, including Sen. Sanders, signed a letter sent to President Obama this week urging him to use executive authority to ban workplace discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of federal contractors. It’s legal in 33 states to fire or harass someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. In the absence of congressional action, a growing number of lawmakers are looking for the president to take action on the issue, The Huffington Post reported.   U.S. and Russia Swap Sanctions: President Barack Obama on Thursday announced that he would expand sanctions against Russian leaders and opened the door to broader measures against Russian energy exports, The New York Times reported. In a tit-for-tat response, Moscow banned nine American officials from entering Russia, including Speaker John A. Boehner, the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, Senator John McCain of Arizona, as well as three senior White House officials.

Raise the Wage:   Sen. Bernie Sanders is a cosponsor of Senate legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. More than 28 million workers nationwide – including 38,300 in Vermont – would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. In a significant way, everyone would benefit because boosting the purchasing power of minimum-wage workers would stimulate the economy overall.

President Barack Obama was urged to make a ban on discrimination against gay and transgender workers a condition for receiving federal contracts. “An executive order covering LGBT employees would be in line with a bipartisan, decades-long commitment to eradicating taxpayer-funded discrimination in the workplace,” the letter to the president said. Sen. Bernie Sanders was among 47 senators and 148 House members who signed the letter. The Senate last Nov. 7 passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act that would outlaw workplace discrimination by all employers. The House, however, has refused to take up its version of the bill.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Mayor Sanders Made Burlington What it is Today: The dominant political figure in Burlington’s modern history is Bernie Sanders. Running for mayor as an independent, Sanders beat a longtime Democratic incumbent by 10 votes. The Democratic-dominated city council tried to thwart every appointment, proposal, and piece of legislation Sanders put forward. He fought back, according to The Atlantic. What he calls his “major political achievement” came when he ran for reelection in 1983, after two years in office. Voter turnout doubled, and he won an easy victory: “People saw something happening in the city, and they wanted to be involved.”  White House Launches Climate Initiative: The White House launched an initiative Wednesday aimed at expanding the use of climate data nationwide, to help communities cope with the impacts of global warming. The effort includes making federal data more accessible through climate.data.gov and launching a design competition to demonstrate the extent to which Americans are vulnerable to coastal flooding, The Washington Post reported.   Boehner Rejects Bipartisan Jobless Aid Plan: House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday he would not bring the Senate's proposed bill to renew jobless aid to the House floor, citing concerns that the proposal would be too expensive for states unequipped to retroactively distribute benefits, the Los Angeles Times reported.   USPS: The Postal Service should have the flexibility to provide new consumer products and services … It is now against the law for workers in post offices to notarize or make copies of documents; to cash checks; to deliver wine or beer; or to engage in e-commerce activities, such as … selling non-postal products on the Internet or offering a noncommercial version of Gmail. The Postal Service inspector general suggests that almost $9 billion a year could be generated by providing financial services. At a time when more than 80 million lower-income Americans have no bank accounts or are forced to rely on rip-off check-cashing storefronts and payday lenders, these kinds of financial services would be of huge social benefit,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Tuesday by the Columbia (Mo.) Daily Journal.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/032014 
The U.S. Cities With the Highest Levels of Income Segregation - Richard Florida, The Atlantic:
 
 Debates in the U.S. over income inequality have taken center stage in recent years, but its existence in our cities is of long standing. Major metro areas have been magnets for both the rich and the poor since ancient times; in fact they owe a great deal of their dynamism to their economic and social diversity. But growing economic segregation—the increasing tendency of affluent people to live in neighborhoods where almost everyone else is affluent, and poor people to live in neighborhoods where almost everyone else is poor—may be a more insidious problem. The emergence of a new urban geography of concentrated wealth and advantage juxtaposed to endemic poverty and concentrated disadvantage poses troubling implications for the economic mobility of people and the economic health of cities.
 
 Just as lower-skill, higher-pay manufacturing jobs have dropped out of the labor market, and work in America has bifurcated into high-skill, high-paying professional and knowledge occupations and much lower-paying, low-skill service jobs in fields like food service and retail trade, America’s once middle-class neighborhoods have also begun to disappear.

Must Read: The 1% Have Gained Back Their Recession Losses and Then Some - Christopher Ingraham, Washington Post:   The OECD just released the seventh edition of its Society at a Glance report, a data-driven barometer of the economic and social health of its 34 member countries, including the United States. The top-line finding for the United States is that the share of pre-tax income going to the top 1 percent of earners continues to be the highest among OECD countries, standing at 19.3 percent in 2012.  This share has more than doubled since 1980. The economic crisis of 2007-2008 took a small bite out of top income shares, but since then the 1 percent regained its losses and even increased its share of the pie relative to its prerecession high.  No matter how you slice the data, things are great at the top end of the income distribution. The top 10 percent of wage earners are closing in on 50 percent of the pie, while the top 0.1 percent are taking in nearly 10 percent of the income. For some historical context, consider that the 0.1 percent now claim a larger share of income than the 1 percent did in the early '80s, and the 1 percent are now earning nearly as much as the top 5 percent did during the same period. Bear in mind that these figures are exclusive of capital gains – if investment income were included, these shares would be even higher.

Today's News  Employee Non-Discrimination: Sen. Bernie Sanders was among 47 senators and 148 House members who signed a letter calling on President Barack Obama to sign an executive order providing workplace protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of federal contractors, The Huffington Post and Daily Kos reported.   Putin Claims Crimea for Russia: Within minutes of delivering a passionate speech to Russia’s political elite, a defiant President Vladimir V. Putin claimed Crimea as a part of Russia on Tuesday by signing a draft treaty with Crimean leaders to make the strategic Black Sea peninsula part of Russia, The New York Times reported.   Progressives Progress: Markos Moulitsas, the founder of Daily Kos, marked his blog’s 10th anniversary with a post on “progressive advances” in the last decade including better access to health care and a renewed push on economic issues such as minimum wage hikes and income inequality. The Senate, controlled by Republicans a decade ago, then had a small “progressive end” that included Sens. Barbara Boxer and Barbara Mikulski. Today, he wrote, they have been reinforced by Tammy Baldwin, Sherrod Brown, Al Franken, Martin Heinrich, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Chris Murphy, Sanders, Brian Schatz, Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse.   Health Care: Progressives in Congress have been taking on issues that matter like raising Social Security benefits, according to The Huffington Post. “Just last week, Sen. Sanders -- the people's champion -- held a hearing on the merits of going to a single-payer health care system,” the article added.

Women's Rights, Religious Rights, Corporate Rights:  The Supreme Court next Tuesday will hear oral arguments on whether a business which provides health insurance would be required to include birth control in that insurance. Two companies, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp., brought separate cases in different courts, but the cases are being heard together at the Supreme Court. Hobby Lobby is an Oklahoma-based chain of craft stores; Conestoga Wood is a cabinet maker based in Pennsylvania. The business owners claim that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act – which provides that the government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” – allows a for-profit, secular corporation to deny its employees health insurance coverage for contraceptives.  Making the case for women’s rights, Sen. Bernie Sanders joined a group of senators in a friend-of-the-court brief rebutting the businesses’ contention. The senators’ legal brief said the religious freedom law did not extend rights to non-religious, for-profit corporations.  They told the Supreme Court that letting a company disobey the health care law would undermine the government’s interest in providing women access to preventive health care, including contraceptive coverage.  Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act already contains protections for nonprofit religious organizations who do not wish to provide such coverage.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Budget: At a Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing last week, Chairman Sanders asked VA Secretary Eric Shinseki about his plans to eliminate a backlog in disability benefits claims by the end of 2015. “We are on path to do that,” Shinseki said in a report broadcast Monday by Federal News Radio WTOP-AM in Washington, D.C. Sanders also asked the VA undersecretary for health care, Dr. Robert Petzel, about the use of acupuncture for treating pain. Petzel said veterans are drawn to alternative treatments because “people want to use the least risky way to manage their pain.”   Media Double Standard: Budget proposals by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders don’t get as much media attention as proposals by Rep. Paul Ryan and other conservatives, Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research director wrote for The Guardian.   Putin Recognizes Crimea's Independence: Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday signed a treaty with two leaders from the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea agreeing to see the region annexed into Russia, and squarely blamed "so-called" authorities in the Ukrainian capital for the ongoing crisis in the country, The Associated Press reported.

When so few have so much, and so many have so little, our democracy and economy are under fierce assault.  This is not what America is supposed to be about.  This must change.
Sanctions on Russia:  President Barack Obama on Monday froze the U.S. assets of seven Russians close to President Vladimir Putin. The European Union announced similar sanctions one day after voters in Crimea supported a Russian-backed referendum to secede from Ukraine. “The entire world has got to stand up to Putin. We've got to deal with sanctions,” Sen. Bernie Sanders had said in a television interview last Friday night. He said freezing Russians’ assets was one possible recourse. “There are a number of things that you could do. But this is what you don't do: You don't go to war. You don't sacrifice lives of young people in this country as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.”  Take the poll: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/russia-ukraine
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Crimea Votes to Secede from Ukraine: With thousands of heavily-armed Russian troops occupying their peninsula, an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted on Sunday to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, resolutely carrying out a public referendum that Western leaders had declared illegal and vowed to punish with economic sanctions.  Heroin Hearing: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a field hearing today in Rutland, Vt., on heroin and opioid addiction in the state. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman, said the witnesses will include the U.S. attorney for Vermont, the Rutland police chief, the Vermont health commissioner, the director of the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Burlington and the director of the Vermont State Police.   St. Patrick’s Day Snow: Schools and government offices were closed throughout the mid-Atlantic region on Monday and authorities urged people to stay off the roads. The federal government and the District of Columbia government are closed and heavy snow shut down runways at Reagan National Airport. With up to 10 inches of snow already on the ground in parts of the Washington area, a Winter Storm Warning remained in effect through 2 p.m. Monday, The Associated Press reported.

Poverty is a Death Sentence:  Fairfax County, Va., and McDowell County, W.Va., are only 350 miles apart.  Suburban Fairfax County’s median family income of $107,000 is one of the highest in the United States, five times more than in rural McDowell County. That stark difference has life and death consequences. Residents of the West Virginia county die years younger. The link between income and longevity was examined  at a Senate hearing last Nov. 20, and on Sunday by The New York Times. “Poverty is a thief,” said Michael Reisch of the University of Maryland in testimony before Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Senate subcommittee on health and aging. “Poverty not only diminishes a person’s life chances, it steals years from one’s life.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/poverty-is-a-death-sentence

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming “The scientific community has been extremely clear — no debate —climate change is real, climate change is man-made, and climate change is already causing severe damage in terms of drought, floods, forest fires, rising sea levels, and extreme weather disturbances,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said during an all-night Senate floor discussion last week to support action to combat climate change. Excerpts from his speech were published in Sunday’s Burlington Free Press.  Crimea Votes on Secession: The Crimean region voted on Sunday about whether to demand greater autonomy from Ukraine or split off and seek to join Russia, in a referendum that has been condemned as illegal by the United States and European countries. Russia raised the stakes Saturday when its forces, backed by helicopter gunships and armored vehicles, took control of a village near the border with Crimea, in the first military move outside the peninsula, The Associated Press reported.  Poor Die Younger: Fairfax County, Va., and McDowell County, W.Va., are separated by 350 miles. Just outside of Washington, Fairfax County’s median family income of $107,000 is one of the highest in the nation. With the decline of coal, the median household income in McDowell is about one-fifth that of Fairfax. One of the starkest consequences of that divide is life expectancy. Residents of Fairfax County are among the longest-lived in the country: Men have an average life expectancy of 82 years and women, 85. In McDowell, the averages are 64 and 73, The New York Times reported.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/031614

What do you do? What you do is say that in America we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. By doing that we're going to create millions of jobs,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday on The O’Reilly Factor on Fox News.  West Must Stand Up to Putin: Western leaders have resisted the use of military force to keep Russian President Vladimir Putin in check in advance of a referendum Sunday in Crimea, which is expected to secede from Ukraine and be annexed by Russia. “The entire world has got to stand up to Putin. We've got to deal with sanctions,” Sen. Sanders said in a Fox News interview. Freezing Russian assets is one possibility he suggested. “There are a number of things that you could do. But this is what you don't do. You don't go to war. You don't sacrifice lives of young people in this country as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.”   Talks on Crimea Crisis Break Down: Talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over this weekend's referendum on Crimea joining Russia broke down after five hours Friday, as Western leaders warned that sanctions were looming, The Wall Street Journal reported. At the White House, President Barack Obama said there would be "consequences" if Russia continues to violate Ukraine's sovereignty. U.S. and European Union officials say actions to impose sanctions will begin Monday unless there is evidence of a pullback by Moscow.

The Week in Review:  A spunky family physician from Canada was the star witness at a Tuesday hearing about how other countries provide health care at less cost and get better outcomes than the United States. Sen. Bernie Sanders chaired the hearing. The White House would be required to submit a plan for reducing childhood poverty in the U.S. under a Sanders provision added to a bill that passed the Senate on Thursday. President Obama set the gears in place for millions more workers to get overtime pay. And senators began the week by keeping the Senate in session for all-night talk-a-thon on global warming.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Welcomes Obama Action on Overtime Pay: President Obama ordered the Labor Department on Thursday to revise federal rules on overtime pay to make millions more workers eligible for extra pay when they work more than 40 hours a week. Sen. Bernie Sanders told the Ed Shultz Radio Show that he hopes regulators will adjust the overtime threshold to raise wages for those making less than $1,000 per week. Sanders said the move marks a shift in focus to “the most pressing problem” the nation faces – high levels of income and wealth inequality.    Senate Passes Child Care Bill: The Senate passed legislation Thursday to renew programs providing health care and food assistance to children. “More than 1 in 5 children in America live in households that lack consistent access to adequate food because their parents don’t make enough money,” Sen. Sanders said in a report on the Washington, D.C., all-news radio station WTOP-FM.   Health Care: Experts from around the world testified about health care systems that are more effective and efficient than the United States’ model. At a Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Sanders, Dr. Danielle Martin, a physician and health policy professor from Toronto, sparred with Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican anti-Obamacare senator, about Canada's health care system. “She more than held her own,” Sanders told the Toronto Sun. Martin was called “Canada’s newest hero” in The Huffington Post. Her testimony also was featured in reports for Yahoo News Canada, Daily Kos and Wonkette.   Health Care: In what Canada’s CBC News called “some political theatre,” Sen. Sanders “playfully” asked Dr. Martin if Canada’s current prime minister is a socialist. “No sir, our prime minister is quite conservative,” Dr. Martin said. “So obviously, as a conservative he wants to implement the American health-care system. I gather that is the first thing he did when he took power, is that right?” Sanders asked. “Not exactly,” the Toronto physician replied. “Support for single-payer Medicare in Canada goes across all political stripes.”  Continue reading today's news: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/031414a
Working Overtime:  President Barack Obama on Thursday called for new overtime rules so more workers will be eligible for time-and-a-half pay after putting in a 40-hour workweek. Obama’s directive to the Labor Department eventually will help millions of low-wage workers. Now, a worker on  salary of more than $455 a week with minimal management duties may be denied overtime.  Sen. Bernie Sanders applauded the president’s action. “It is absurd that millions of workers making as little as $455 a week are considered ‘supervisors’ and get no overtime pay.  I hope the Department of Labor raises that threshold to at least $1,000, which would reflect inflation since 1975. That step alone would mean a raise for millions of workers. More money in the hands of working people would mean that those workers could then go out and make purchases that would help create more jobs.”  It will take a while before workers see any more money in their paychecks. Leaving the details to be worked out by the Labor Department, Obama did not specify what the new salary thresholds should be. The department isn’t likely to propose specific language until this fall.  Workers won the right to overtime pay back in 1938, when Congress passed a law requiring extra pay for extra hours of work. Under the law, the Labor Department was given the authority to change the salary thresholds to account for inflation. The department also was given leeway to spell out which workers are eligible for overtime. The last time the rules were updated, however, was 1975. That’s when the Ford administration raised the salary threshold significantly to account for inflation.
Childhood Poverty in America:  The childhood poverty rate in the United States is greater than in any other major country. So as senators on Wednesday worked on a bill that would reauthorize a federal child care block grant, Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed an  amendment calling on President Barack Obama to submit a five-year plan to reduce childhood poverty. “The United States of America is the richest country in the history of the world. Unfortunately, despite our great wealth, more of our citizens are living in poverty than ever before and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country in the industrialized world. We have a moral responsibility to end childhood poverty in America,” Sanders said.  Read more: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/childhood-poverty-in-america
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Health Care: Experts from around the world told a Senate panel this week that health care systems in other countries outperform the United States’ complicated and expensive private system. Dr. Danielle Martin, a physician and health policy professor from Toronto, countered what the Los Angeles Times called Sen. Richard Burr’s “I-don't-need-no-stinkin'-facts approach to health policy.” The physician called out the American system’s failure to treat 45,000 who die each year because they lack health insurance.  CIA Torture Cover-Up: Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein this week publicly accused the Central Intelligence Agency of interfering with a Senate investigation into Bush-era interrogation and detention practices. Sen. Sanders previously raised concerns about the National Security Agency's domestic spying activities in a January letter asking if the agency had ever spied on members of Congress, The Washington Post online, Fox Business News and the Italian newspaper il Fatto Mondo reported.  VA Budget: Lawmakers from both parties raised worries at a veterans’ committee hearing on Wednesday that the VA budget request may not be enough, particularly when the wind-down of the Afghanistan war is sending a growing influx of servicemen and women into the VA system, National Journal reported. “The VA anticipates seeing an increase of approximately 100,000 new patients in the coming year," said Sen. Sanders, the veterans’ panel chairman, said at a hearing on the budget request. “Is that enough money? It sounds to me like it's not.”  Banking on the Postal Service: Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, said Wednesday that Congress should allow the Postal Service to provide banking services to millions of Americans. “Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are pushing for that,” host Ed Schultz noted on MSNBC.

Health Care: U.S. vs. Canada  Dr. Danielle Martin, a family physician from Toronto, compared health care in her country to the more expensive but less effective system in the United States.  She was questioned at a Senate hearing on Tuesday by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the health subcommittee chairman, and Sen. Richard Burr, the ranking Republican. With a hint of sarcasm, Sanders asked the doctor to explain how come the conservative Canadian premier hasn’t gotten rid of the country’s health care system. In another exchange, as the Los Angeles Times put it, Dr. Martin “bats down the myths and misunderstandings about the Canadian system that Burr throws at her.” Burr, for example, asked why former Newfoundland Premier Danny Williams had a heart valve operation in Miami, where he owns a condo, instead of in Canada.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  CIA Cover Up in Torture Probe: A conflict between the Central Intelligence Agency and the Senate Intelligence Committee boiled over Tuesday when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panel chairwoman and one of the CIA’s staunchest defenders, accused the CIA of withholding information about its use of torture in the interrogation of prisoners. She also accused the spy agency of trying to intimidate committee staff members investigating the interrogation program. To Sen. Bernie Sanders, the revelation was “another sign that our intelligence community is out of control and that there must be greater oversight by Congress,” the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported. Earlier this year, in response to a question from Sanders, the National Security Agency did not expressly deny spying on Congress, The Nation noted.  Health Care: Sen. Bernie Sanders tried Tuesday to revive debate about whether there would be benefit to involving the federal government more deeply in the nation’s medical system. The Vermont independent highlighted at a hearing how the United States spends more on health care than many other nations that have more extensive government involvement in their medical systems, but doesn’t seem to achieve better results than they do, Congressional Quarterly reported. Former Taiwanese health minister Ching-Chuan Yeh told a Senate hearing that Americans could learn from Taiwan’s example, Taiwan’s China Times and Taiwan Today reported. Yeh became the first Taiwanese Cabinet-level official to testify at a United States Senate hearing, the Central News Agency reported.  Obama Will Seek Overtime Pay Expansion: President Obama this week will seek to force American businesses to pay more overtime to millions of workers, the latest move by his administration to confront corporations that have had soaring profits even as wages have stagnated. On Thursday, the president will direct the Labor Department to revamp its regulations to require overtime pay for several million additional fast-food managers, loan officers, computer technicians and others whom many businesses currently classify as “executive or professional” employees to avoid paying them overtime, according to The New York Times.  VA Budget: The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing to discuss funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, roughly one week after President Obama proposed boosting the VA budget by 3 percent. Secretary Eric Shinseki is slated to testify. The Senate last month rejected a sweeping bill sponsored by Sanders, the committee chairman, that would have expanded benefits for former service members and repealed a controversial pension cut for future troops, The Washington Post reported online.

What the U.S. Can Learn About Health Care from Other Countries:  Other major countries offer better health care at less cost than the United States, according to witnesses who testified on Tuesday at a Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “What this hearing is really about is two fundamental issues. First, the U.S., the wealthiest country on the planet, is the only major industrialized country in the world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its citizens. Should we consider joining the rest of the world? I’d argue we should,” Sanders said. “Second, the U.S. spends twice as much as other countries that have much better health outcomes. What can we learn from these countries?” asked Sanders, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: “Climate change is already causing severe damage in terms of draughts, floods, forest fires,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said a late-night Senate floor speech on NBC Radio News. Sanders joined about two dozen other senators in an all-night Senate session to call attention to global warming.  Health Care: The United States should be “profoundly embarrassed” that it spends twice as much per capita on health care than almost every other nation in the world but fails to cover all of its citizens, Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN on Monday.  Campaign Funding: Sen. Sanders told MSNBC’s Ronan Farrow that the United States is moving toward a government run by a few wealthy people. “The Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson are prepared to spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, to elect the president of the United States, to elect senators, to elect governors. That is not the American democracy most of us grew up believing in,” Sanders told Ian Masters on KPFK-FM.   Military Sexual-Assault Bill Easily Passes the Senate: The Senate on Monday passed legislation to bolster protections for sexual-assault victims in the military, ending a battle over how such crimes should be prosecuted. While the bill made it through the Senate on a 97-0 vote, it capped months of sharply personal debate between the measure's champion, Sen. Claire McCaskill and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, The Wall Street Journal reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/031114

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming All-Nighter: Sen. Bernie Sanders will help lead an overnight session of the Senate’s Climate Action Task Force in what he terms a wake-up call on global warming. Sanders — co-sponsor of a bill that would tax carbon and methane emissions — will be joined by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Maine Sen. Angus King and two dozen other task force members. The overnight session will take place on the Senate floor Monday night through Tuesday morning, The Associated Press reported.  Toomey Votes Against Veterans: “Despite proclaiming himself a champion of veterans and making grandiose statements about our society's obligation to take care of them, Sen. [Pat] Toomey was one of 41 Senators - all Republicans - who defeated a recent bill that would have expanded veterans' benefits … Veterans are furious. Veteran Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said … he'd be working hard in the upcoming weeks to convince the necessary number of Republicans to reconsider their votes. We urge Sen. Toomey to distinguish himself and honor his commitment to military veterans by being one of the Republicans who does just that,” The Philadelphia Daily News editorialized.   Long-Term Unemployment: Both Democrats and Republicans offered up fresh proposals this week that would renew emergency unemployment insurance for the long-term jobless, injecting another batch of uncertainty into the debate. Democrats’ six-month proposal would use a large portion of the farm law’s savings to cover the $12 billion price tag, an unpopular option among Republicans. The Republican plan would combine several offsets to pay for a $10-billion, five-month measure that includes some program reforms.  Both bills would extend benefits retroactively to Dec. 28, when long-term unemployment insurance expired, The Hill reported.   Comcast Cash on Capitol Hill:  The Philadelphia cable giant, historically a major Beltway player, is sure to strengthen its political offense in order to sell $45 billion bid for Time Warner Cable. Comcast has donated to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it. They know that the money they give to both Republicans and Democrats buys them access — everybody admits that in Washington today,” Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, told Politico. “So they have covered their bases by giving to nearly every single member of the committees that do oversight.” Dueling bills to renew a federal unemployment benefits program could trip up efforts to get legislation passed in the Senate.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Women March in Montpelier: More than 150 people from around Vermont turned out in Montpelier on Saturday for what was billed as the “Women’s March for Dignity” — an event scheduled to coincide with International Women’s Day. Haley Pero, representing Sen. Bernie Sanders, said women are paid less than men, face workplace discrimination and are underrepresented “in positions of political and economic power.” Sanders supports a bill that would require Vermont employers to provide paid sick leave to all full- and part-time workers, the Rutland Herald, Times Argus and WCAX-TV reported.   Veterans: Senate Republicans blocked legislation by Sen. Sanders to expand veterans’ benefits. “They say their concern is they didn’t like the way it was paid for. I’m good friends with Bernie Sanders who chairs the veterans committee and he’s going to attempt to bring it back again,” Rep. Peter DeFazio told the University of Oregon’s Daily Emerald. “We’ll see if the Republicans were really against it because they didn’t like the pay for or if they just don’t really care about veterans. Given the record of the Bush administration, it could be the former.” LINK   Senate Moves Forward on Military Sexual Assault Bill: The Senate will vote Monday on a measure that would expand current protections for victims of sexual assault in the military, after narrowly rejecting a competing bill to remove the decision for prosecuting such crimes from the chain of command. The Senate is expected to pass the measure by Sen. Claire McCaskill, Congressional Quarterly reported.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/030914

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Military Sexual Assault Bill Blocked: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's bill to fundamentally revamp the military justice system for sexual assault victims hit a wall yesterday in the Senate. An unusually bipartisan majority in the Senate voted 55-45 to break a filibuster of her bill, but that fell short of the 60 votes needed to clear it for a final vote. She had built a bipartisan coalition which included 17 of the 20 women senators and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper Newsday reported.   Veterans' Funding Extended: White House officials announced Wednesday that the Department of Veterans Affairs would shift new funding to the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program to ensure that veterans' tuition payments would be paid through the end of the semester. Payments were set to expire this month. More than 126,000 people have taken part in the program, aimed at veterans ages 35 to 60 who have no other VA education benefits. Sen. Sanders has introduced legislation that would reauthorize the program for two more years, Military Times reported.   Save the USPS: Sen. Sanders defended the Postal Service in an op-ed published by The Huffington Post, saying there is no need to end Saturday mail or dismantle the postal service.

Tar Sands Oil in Vermont" A decision by Canada’s National Energy Board on Thursday will bring oil extracted from tar sands a step closer to New England. A 263-mile Portland-Montreal pipeline currently carries light crude oil from Maine through the Northeast Kingdom to Quebec, but the pipeline owner wants to reverse the flow. Sen. Sanders and other Vermont leaders “have been strong allies in the fight against toxic tar sands oil,” Ben Walsh, Clean Energy Advocate at VPIRG, told VTDigger. “We call on them once again to stand up for Vermonters, and make sure the federal government gives any tar sands project the scrutiny we deserve.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/030714
Protecting Sexual Assault Victims:   The Senate on Thursday advanced a bill to reform the military justice system but blocked stronger legislation by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to give professional military trial lawyers the power to refer serious crimes to courts-martial.  "An estimated 26,000 service members were sexually assaulted in 2012, a 37 percent increase in just one year, according to a recent Department of Defense study. I voted for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s bill because it would give servicemen and women an independent route outside the chain of command to report serious crimes, and I am disappointed that it was defeated," Sen. Bernie Sanders said after a key Senate vote.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-military-sexual-assault-cases

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama Wrong on Trade: President Barack Obama released his annual trade agenda this week in an indication that the administration plans to push for the same NAFTA-style trade policies it has in the past, John Nichols wrote for The Nation. Sen. Bernie Sanders has criticized NAFTA, calling it a horrendous “race to the bottom” for lower wages and fewer good-paying jobs.   Shame on Senators Who Blocked Veterans Bill: “What does it take to shame these senators,” Jon Stewart asked on the Daily Show segment that ridiculed Sens. Richard Burr and Jeff Sessions and Marco Rubio.   Pope Francis: Pope Francis' emphasis on economic issues has resonated with elected officials in the United States. Sen. Sanders said he considered the pope a “strong ally” on the issue of income inequality, the student newspaper service UWIRE reported.

There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Wall Street Journal: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/theres-no-need-to-end-saturday-mail-delivery
There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   The U.S. Postal Service is one of our most popular and important government agencies. It provides universal service six days a week to every corner of America, no matter how small or remote. It supports millions of jobs in virtually every other sector of our economy. It provides decent-paying union jobs to some 500,000 Americans, and it is the largest employer of veterans.  Whether you are a low-income elderly woman living at the end of a dirt road in Vermont or a wealthy CEO living on Park Avenue, you get your mail six days a week. And you pay for this service at a cost far less than anywhere else in the industrialized world.  Yet the Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service. They see an opportunity for Wall Street and corporate America to make billions in profits out of these services, and couldn't care less how privatization or a degradation of services affects ordinary Americans.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama Budget: President Obama on Tuesday sent Congress a $3.9 trillion budget that seeks to boost economic growth and reduce the national debt by raising taxes on the rich. Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Ed Schultz Show that the president’s proposals would provide major investments in creating jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, expanding community health centers and improving the lives and educational opportunities of our children.   Obama Retreats on Social Security: Cuts Obama dropped a proposal to change the way inflation is calculated for Social Security and other federal benefits. The budget also contains significant tax increases on the wealthy, tax cuts for the working class and $56 billion in increased spending above the 2015 budget cap. “At a time when the wealthiest Americans are doing phenomenally well, [the budget] asks some of the richest people in the country to start paying their fair share of taxes,” said Sen. Sanders said in The Hill. PoliticusUSA noted that Sanders welcomed Obama’s decision to drop proposed cuts to Social Security.   VA Budget: Veterans groups say the proposed Department of Veterans Affairs budget fails to address construction and maintenance needs at VA facilities across the country. The VA proposes to spend about $1.2 billion on construction projects next year, which is about $2.75 billion less than what veterans’ organizations recommend. A provision in a comprehensive veterans' bill by Sen. Sanders would have provided funding for leases to 27 facilities across the U.S. and Puerto Rico. But that bill failed last month in a partisan vote, military.com reported.   Save Saturday Mail: “The U.S. Postal Service … provides universal service six days a week to every corner of America, no matter how small or remote. It supports millions of jobs in virtually every other sector of our economy … Yet the Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack … [because] there are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs,” Sen.

The Facts About the Koch Brothers - Senator Harry Reid:  1. The Kochs want to abolish Social Security.  “Documents and interviews unearthed in recent months by Brave New Foundation researchers illustrate a $28.4m Koch business that has manufactured 297 commentaries, 200 reports, 56 studies and six books distorting social security’s effectiveness and purpose.”  Read more  2. The Kochs want to eliminate minimum wage laws.  “According to Charles Koch, the U.S. needs to get rid of the minimum wage, which he counts as a major obstacle to economic growth.” Read more.  3. The Kochs are against extending emergency unemployment benefits.  “It causes employers to face higher taxes, too, which discourages them from hiring new employees.”  Read more.  4. The Kochs spent $400 million on misleading attack ads in the last election cycle.  “A labyrinth of tax-exempt groups and limited-liability companies helps mask the sources of the money, much of which went to voter mobilization and television ads attacking President Obama and congressional Democrats, according to tax filings and campaign finance reports.”  Read more.  5. The Kochs want to put insurance companies back in charge of your health care.  “In Louisiana, the Koch brother’s Americans for Prosperity was blasted for running anti-Obamacare ads featuring paid actors to play Louisiana residents telling “their” stories about how Obamacare had harmed them.”  Read more.

Bernie Sanders on Monday called for a measured approach to what he called a “complicated issue” in Ukraine. In an MSNBC interview, Sanders said Russia’s military moves in Eastern Europe require “serious international discussions.”   Coburn, Inhofe, Cruz, Cornyn Vote against Veterans: The Senate last week failed to move forward on a bill that would expand education and health care programs for veterans. Senators voted 56-41 for the bill, but it needed a budget waiver requiring 60 votes, and so it fell short. Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas and Tom Coburn and James Inhofe voted no, according to The (Dennison, Tex.) Herald Democrat and the Longview, Tex., News-Journal.   Ron Johnson Votes against Veterans: Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would greatly improve how America treats our veterans. After the vote, Sen. Sanders was livid. “I … have a hard time understanding how anyone could vote for tax breaks for billionaires, for millionaires, for large corporations and then say we don't have the resources to protect our veterans.” Sen. Ron Johnson's vote to kill the veterans bill “was not the first time that he voted against the interests of those who have served in the defense of our country. His record is one of disdain and outright hostility to veterans' issues,” Paul Adair wrote in a column for the suburban Milwaukee Germantown Now.   Veterans Lose: “Republicans are deceiving themselves if they think those 22 million veterans and their families aren’t going to hold this vote against their party. Yes, the Democrats are just as uncompromising, but they did vote for the Senate veterans bill,” Jim Beam wrote for the American Press in Lake Charles, La. Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and author of the legislation, said the fight for veterans isn’t over.

The Forbes World's Billionaires List:   Forbes magazine on Monday came out with its annual ranking of the world’s richest people. Among the top 10 billionaires were three men who have put vast sums into swaying the outcomes of American elections. Charles and David Koch, with fortunes that Forbes’ pegged at $40 Billion each, were the sixth richest people in the world. Las Vegas gambling tycoon Sheldon Adelson came in eighth. The Koch brothers and Adelson have played growing roles in bankrolling favored politicians since the Supreme Court in 2010 struck down limits on campaign spending. “Because of this disastrous Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, a bad situation—and it’s been bad for a while—has become much worse,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an Truthdig interview.  Sanders also talked about how big money controls Congress. “Despite the fact that we have a collapsing middle class, more people living in poverty than at any time during our history, and the gap between the very, very rich and everyone else growing wider, it is very hard for me to imagine significant legislation being passed that Wall Street and the big money interests don’t want,” the senator told Truthdig’s Alexander Reed Kelly.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Big Money in Washington: “People do not fully appreciate the degree to which big money, campaign contributions and lobbying and PACs and corporate media play in whether or not serious legislation is discussed and passed,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Truthdigger.com. “Despite the fact that we have a collapsing middle class, more people living in poverty than at any time during our history, and the gap between the very, very rich and everyone else growing wider, it is very hard for me to imagine significant legislation being passed that Wall Street and the big money interests don’t want.”   Community Building: A new book holds up Vermont’s largest city as an example for the rest of the nation. “Citing Burlington’s rise to award-winning status, and harkening back to the days when … Sanders was mayor, the book explores a confluence of opportunities — community planning, social enterprise development, energy and environment, food systems and cultural well-being — and the players who aptly were aware enough to take advantage of those key moments in time,” Steven Pappas wrote in a book review for the Times Argus and Rutland Herald. The book is “Sustainable Communities: Creating a Durable Local Economy” by Rhonda Phillips, Bruce Seifer and Ed Antczak.   Vermont Yankee: Sen. Sanders wants the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to provide a stronger role for states in the process of decommissioning nuclear power plants. Unless the NRC makes changes on its own, he said he would introduce legislation, VTDigger reported. Citing a long history of safety problems at Entergy’s Vermont Yankee reactor, he said “the prospect of letting a dangerous plant sit there for many decades makes Vermonters uncomfortable.”  Obama Works to Rein in Russia: President Vladimir V. Putin on Sunday sent more Russian troops to tighten its grip on the Crimean Peninsula. President Barack Obama tried to isolate Moscow. Working the telephone from the Oval Office, Obama rallied allies, agreed to send Secretary of State John Kerry to Kiev and approved a series of diplomatic and economic moves, The New York Times reported. From Capitol Hill, Obama was urged to take more assertive action to stop Russia’s leader. Kick “him out of the G-8” altogether, said Sen. Richard Durbin. “Create a democratic noose around Putin’s Russia,” urged Sen. Lindsey Graham. “Revisit the missile defense shield,” suggested Sen. Marco Rubio. “Cancel Sochi,” argued Rep. Mike Rogers, who leads the House Intelligence Committee, referring to the Group of 8 summit meeting to be hosted by Putin.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Threatening War, Ukraine Mobilizes Troops: Russia’s move to seize control of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula on Saturday led Ukraine to call up its military reserves on Sunday and warn Moscow against further incursions as Western powers scrambled to find a response to the crisis. President Obama accused Russia on Saturday of a “breach of international law” and condemned the country’s military intervention, calling it a “clear violation” of Ukrainian sovereignty.  ‘Foolhardy’ Burr Votes against Veterans: A divided Senate derailed legislation that would have provided $21 billion for medical, education and job-training benefits for the nation's veterans. Republicans said there would be no retribution from voters. “We're sort of fooling ourselves to believe that this drives the election issue list,” said Sen. Richard Burr, the top Republican on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer and The (Raleigh, N.C.) News & Observer and Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer. By trying to hitch the veterans measure to tighter sanctions on Iran, Burr was “playing foolhardy election-year politics with a delicate negotiation,” the N&O said in an editorial.   Session and Shelby Vote against Veterans: Voting 56 for and 41 against, against, the Senate on Thursday failed to reach the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican blockage of a bill that would have expanded veterans' benefits at a cost of $21 billion over 10 years in areas such as health care, college-tuition assistance, employment and military-retirement pay. Sens. Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby of Alabama voted no, according to the Columbus (Ga.) Ledger-Inquirer and The (Lanett, Ala.) Valley Times-News.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Republican Senators Vote against Veterans: The Senate this week derailed a bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders that would have offered $21 billion in medical, educational, and job-training benefits for veterans. “It really was quite incredible to see almost all Republicans -- we got two -- almost all Republicans put their partisan loyalty ahead of the needs of the veterans in this country,” Sanders, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, said in an interview Friday on MSNBC.   CNN Blasts Republicans on Vets Vote: CNN anchor Chris Cuomo lambasted Senate Republicans on Friday for blocking a bill that would have expanded veterans benefits, HNGN and Mediaite reported. The "New Day" host called it "outrageous" for Republicans to block the bill and urged viewers to "take to social media" to protest.  Koch Groups Lie About Carbon Tax: The Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group is running advertisements in Alaska claiming that Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is “on record supporting a carbon tax."

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate Republicans Block Veterans Bill: Senate Republicans on Thursday derailed a comprehensive bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders that would have expanded health care, education and job-training programs for veterans, The Associated Press, Reuters and others reported. Although GOP Sens. Dean Heller and Jerry Moran voted with Democrats, the legislation still failed to overcome a Republican parliamentary maneuver that required 60 votes. “I am going to keep going on this. We are not going to give up on our veterans,” Sanders said at a news conference after the vote. “At some point, we are going to pass this legislation.”   Republicans Vote Against Veterans was ‘Outrageous,’ CNN Says: On the CNN program New Day this morning, host Chris Cuomo called it “outrageous” that Senate Republicans blocked Sen. Sanders’ legislation. Sanders “had to beg for the gridlock to end” according to CNN. Sanders said injecting issues like Iran sanctions into the debate was “unfair to the veterans of this country.” Senate Republicans, Cuomo added, “did what they do best” and blocked Sanders’ bill. “Blocking our veterans? I don’t have to tell you that’s outrageous,” Cuomo said before calling for a Twitter campaign to urge Republican senators to change their votes.   Veterans Blame Republicans: Veterans panned the Senate defeat of the bill on Thursday, The Washington Post reported. “I don’t know how anyone who voted ‘no’ today can look a veteran in the eye and justify that vote,” said American Legion national commander Daniel M. Dellinger. “Our veterans deserve more than what they got today.” Veterans’ priorities fell victim to partisan gaming in a competitive election year, according to an online Fox News report.   Tax Breaks for Billionaires but No Money for Veterans: Sen. Sanders told the Ed Shultz Radio Show that there is "a lot of opposition from our Republican colleagues, who apparently believe it’s ok to give tax breaks to the largest corporations, the wealthiest families in this country, to spend trillions of dollars on war without figuring out how to pay for it, but when it comes to $21 billion over a 10-year period to take care of veterans and their families, apparently they have difficulty with that." The bill included provisions authored by Sen. Patty Murray that would have overturned a ban on providing reproductive health remedies to wounded veterans, Seattle Weekly reported. Conservatives criticized the bill as too “massive,” according to The Blaze.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/022814

Top veterans groups and military organizations have thrown their support behind the bill, according to Military.com.   Sanders: Iran Amendment Would Torpedo Bill: In an interview on CNN, Sen. Sanders called Republican attempts to attach Iran sanctions to the veterans bill “a means to torpedo what is such an important piece of legislation for millions of our veterans.” The American Legion and Iran and Afghanistan Veterans of America also condemned the effort to attach an Iran sanctions amendment to the bill, The Huffington Post and Bloomberg News reported. Sanders called the attempt to bring up sanctions “silly partisan politics,” according to The Wall Street Journal online. The Iranian government-run Press TV also reported on the sanctions push by Republican.  AIPAC Backs off Iran Sanctions: The Republican push to attach an Iran sanctions rider to Sen. Sanders’ bill came just days after the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee backed off its earlier call for additional sanctions on Iran, Bloomberg reported.

Sanders Bill Would Aid Military Sexual Assault Victims: The Sanders bill would make several changes to how the military handles sexual assault claims. One of those changes is named for Ruth Moore, a resident of Maine, who testified in Congress about her more than two-decade-long fight with the VA to receive treatment and disability compensation for sexual attacks she suffered as a young Navy enlistee.

Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.  “We have made progress but we still have a long way to go if we are to keep faith with those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech before the vote. “I hope very much that we will go down that road together, that we will tell the American people that at least on this one issue we can stand together and protect the interests of those people who have sacrificed so much for our country.”  After the vote, Sanders reacted to Republican senators who want to inject a debate over Iran sanctions into the measure on veterans programs. “We can have honest differences on how to address veterans issues, but it is disrespectful to the millions of veterans in this country to introduce an extraneous provision on Iran sanctions,” Sanders said. “The American people have had enough of silly partisan politics. Let’s focus on veterans issues.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/veterans-bill-clears-senate-hurdle

Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs committee, said there is “some excellent legislation” in Sanders' package, according to USA Today and the Burlington Free Press.   Veterans Back Sanders’ Bill: “Supporting veterans is hardly a politically risky proposition. In fact, it would likely be more difficult for lawmakers to vote against the measure, considering it has the support of several major veterans groups including The American Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America and Veterans of Foreign Wars,” CBS News reported online. As of Monday, Sanders’ had 23 Democratic co-sponsors. There is some Republican support. Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina plans to introduce the bill in the House on Tuesday.

Sanders wrote in an op-ed for The Hill.   Pentagon Budget: Vermont's two United States senators are expressing concern over proposed cuts to the National Guard. “We should be growing - rather than shrinking - the National Guard" because of its cost-efficiency, Sen.

The legislation includes measures to permit veterans to receive in-state tuition benefits should they change their state of residence; provide a broader dental program; and require additional congressional oversight for the Veterans Administration's new digital tracking system for disability claims, National Journal reported.   Comcast: Comcast's plan to buy Time Warner Cable so far has not drawn much explicit opposition on Capitol Hill. Sen. Sanders said more media consolidation would mean "less local control, fewer outlets offering differing viewpoints and less ownership diversity." Sanders posted a poll on his website asking people whether regulators should approve such a deal, Communications Daily reported.  Sen. Al Franken asked the FCC, Justice Department and FTC for a review.  Social Security: President Obama dropped a controversial Social Security plan from his proposed budget. The idea would have held down annual cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. Obama's retreat drew praise from Sen. Sanders. He and more than a dozen Senate Democrats had signed a letter urging Obama to avoid tinkering with Social Security benefits in the proposed spending plan, according to Bankrate.com.   Health Care: The private insurance industry’s profit-making incentive makes health care unaffordable for the poor, but there are promising solutions currently being proposed at the state level. Vermont is already in the process of setting up a statewide single-payer health insurance system. If Vermont’s approach succeeds, we can expect other states to follow. Rep. John Conyers, Jr., has sponsored a single-payer bill in the House and Sen. Sanders has as similar bill in the Senate, Jawad Husain wrote in a letter to the editor of  The Daily Free Press student newspaper at Boston University.

An End to the Grand-Bargain Charades - The New York Times:  The phony budget games finally came to an end this week.   After years of trying to entice Republicans into serious negotiations over a fiscal deal — years of instant rejection and painful austerity — the White House announced it was giving up.  In President Obama’s 2015 budget, scheduled to be unveiled next month, there will be no more proposals to cut entitlement programs. Instead, the president will demand what the country needs the most: new investments in education, in energy efficiency, in job training. When Republicans turn away, as they will, they will have to explain to voters why they prefer tax loopholes for the rich over programs to create jobs and rebuild the economy.  Mr. Obama will not include an offer that marred his 2014 budget plan: reducing the cost-of-living increase for Social Security in exchange for higher spending and the end of some of those loopholes. The Social Security cut, known as a “chained” Consumer Price Index, was never a good idea. It was likely to hurt vulnerable retirees, but had been long advocated by the right. Nonetheless, Republicans refused to consider that change if it meant touching the tax breaks of their wealthiest donors, so they passed up a chance to achieve their stated goal of reducing entitlement spending.  “Over the course of last year, Republicans consistently showed a lack of willingness to negotiate on a deficit-reduction deal,” a White House official said, “refusing to identify even one unfair tax loophole they would be willing to close, despite the president’s willingness to put tough things on the table.”  Continue reading here: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/opinion/an-end-to-the-grand-bargain-charades.html?_r=1
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Propane Prices: Shale gas producers are pulling so much propane out of natural gas wells that they have quadrupled exports in the last three years. But this winter's weird weather triggered an unprecedented domestic shortage of the fuel. Elected officials in propane-dependent states are demanding relief. "The problem is that almost all new propane production over the past three years has been exported to more lucrative overseas markets, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch said in The Philadelphia Inquirer.  Veterans: Congress’ reversal this month of its plan to reduce annual inflation adjustments to the pensions of veterans demonstrated clearly that veterans groups exercise enormous clout in Washington. Earlier this month, veterans groups celebrated the introduction of legislation by Sen. Sanders that would give veterans more access to nontraditional and reproductive medicine, according to Congressional Quarterly.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   A ‘Major Victory’ on Social Security: Sen. Bernie Sanders said grassroots opposition to Social Security cuts persuaded President Obama earlier this week to retreat from a proposal to cut benefits by changing how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated. “It amounts to a major, major victory for the people of this country,” Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. “The lesson is that when we can get the word out we can win these fights.”   Veterans Bill: Sen.

Times-Herald reported.   Trade Deal: Sen. Sanders congratulated the Ed Shultz Radio Show Thursday for covering how a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal would hurt American workers.

NEWS: Sanders Welcomes White House Decision to Protect Social Security:   U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today welcomed a White House announcement that President Barack Obama will not call for cuts in Social Security benefits as part of a budget blueprint that he will submit to Congress on March 4.  “I applaud President Obama for his important decision to protect Social Security,” Sanders said. “With the middle class struggling and more people living in poverty than ever before, we cannot afford to make life even more difficult for seniors and some of the most vulnerable people in America.  I look forward to working with the president to support the needs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor.”    Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-welcomes-white-house_decision-to-protect-social-security
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders on Schools: Sen. Bernie Sanders called for expanded early-child education during testimony on Wednesday before Vermont House and Senate education committees. A politically-divided Congress is unlikely to pass President Barack Obama’s $75 billion early-education plan, but Sanders said Vermont lawmakers could act on their own thanks to $37 million in federal funds awarded to the state to bolster pre-kindergarten programs, according to the Associated Press.   Propane Prices: Significantly higher propane prices during a brutally cold winter prompted Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch to ask Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker for an emergency halt to propane exports, New England Cable News reported. Sanders is set to meet today with top Commerce Department officials, WPTZ-TV reported. Artie Cole, president of the Louisiana Propane Gas Association, said Wednesday the problem isn't exports but the lack of infrastructure that makes it difficult to meet demand for propane during an extremely cold winter, The (New Orleans, La.) Times-Picayune reported.   Wall Street Loses One: Last week's passage of a bill to raise the borrowing limit so the government could pay its bills was a defeat for a pro-austerity, Wall Street-financed campaign that advocates cutting Social Security and other programs that help working families. Writing for The Nation, Mary Bottari recalled the time last year when Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, a leader of the self-styled Fix the Debt campaign, called for raising the retirement age for eligibility to receive Social Security. Sen. Sanders, she said, “hit the roof” over Blankfein’s “unbelievable arrogance.”   Social Security: Democrats are largely unified in opposition to cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. A group of 16 senators led by Sen. Sanders wrote a letter to Obama urging him not to propose cuts to social safety net programs in his budget, Truthout and Salon reported. If House Speaker John Boehner had accepted President Obama's "grand bargain" in 2011, Democrats could have become locked in a bitter internal debate, according to National Journal.

A Trade Deal ‘Disaster’: Sen. Sanders on Tuesday said a proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal would be a “disaster” for American workers. The agreement would involve a dozen nations that make up 40 percent of the global economy. It would help multi-national corporations shift jobs to low-wage workers in countries like Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 28-cents an hour, Sanders said Tuesday on MSNBC. Traveling to Mexico today, President Obama will confer with leaders of Mexico and Canada on his efforts to negotiate the Asian-Pacific trade pact.   Propane Prices: Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch asked Department of Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker to use her emergency powers to temporarily halt exports of propane in an effort to reduce prices for the home heating fuel, the Burlington Free Press and The Hill reported. The Vermont lawmakers said domestic propane prices are 60 percent higher than they were last winter.   Solar Power: Vermont has more solar industry jobs per capita than any other state, according to a Brattleboro Reformer editorial. It quoted Sen. Sanders saying that “a dramatic expansion of solar power is a clean and economical way to help break our dependence on foreign oil, reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, and create good-paying manufacturing and installation jobs in Vermont and across the United States.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/021914

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Propane Prices: Vermont lawmakers want the White House to curb exports of propane to bring down prices that are 60 percent more than last winter, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported. “Costs are skyrocketing. It is a cold winter. People need more fuel,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN on Monday. Matt Cota, director of the Vermont Fuel Dealers Association, told Vermont Public Radio that his organization supports the temporary export ban.  Veterans: Fresh off winning a repeal of retirement pay cuts for current and former military members, veterans groups now want to cancel the cuts for future service members too, saying that the budget can be balanced without targeting veterans. Under the bill passed last week and signed by President Obama on Saturday, the full rate of retirement pay increases was restored for current troops and retirees, but anyone who enlists in the future would see a drop. Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said Congress should build on last week’s repeal and restore the pay for all military retirees, The Washington Times reported.   Liberals Mobilize Against Social Security: Cuts President Obama’s budget is due early next month and already progressives are pushing back against one potential line in the document — the Social Security cuts that Obama has included in his budget in the past. Late last week, 16 senators ranging from liberal independent Sanders to Democrat Mark Begich, who is facing a tough reelection in the red state of Alaska this fall, signed a letter to the White House asking the president not to include the cuts in his budget,” The Washington Post blogged on Monday.

Climate Change: Secretary of State John Kerry today spoke in stark terms about the dangers of climate change and compared those who deny it is happening to people who believe the world is flat. Calling climate change "catastrophic," Kerry called on Indonesia's leaders to work on cutting greenhouse emissions. "Climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction," he said, according to ABC News.   Global Warming: Fierce winter storms in the South and drought in the West have reignited a debate about climate change that has led to near gridlock on Capitol Hill, with Republicans and some Democrats standing in staunch opposition to major legislative proposals to address the issue. Touring drought-ravaged California on Friday, President Obama sounded an ominous warning saying that even if the federal government takes meaningful action to combat climate change, much of the damage already has been done, The Washington Times reported.

Network News Notices Climate Change:  The three major Sunday morning network television shows all featured conversations about climate change on Sunday. Now that’s news. Throughout all of last year, the same programs and Fox News Sunday devoted only 27 minutes – combined – to global warming. Up from just 8 minutes the year before. This Sunday on ABC’s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos discussed how to "get ahead" of climate change with Dr. Heidi Cullen, Climate Central's chief climatologist. The CBS program Face the Nation featured an interview with Dr. Marshall Shepherd, the former head of the American Meteorological Society. And on NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory and scientist Bill Nye countered claims by Rep. Marsha Blackburn that there is no consensus that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming. "But there is consensus," Gregory interjected. "Within the scientific community, there is consensus."

Calling for “urgent and decisive action,” Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch asked Department of Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker to use her emergency powers to temporarily halt exports of propane.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Global Warming on Sunday TV: ABC, CBS and NBC are devoting segments of their Sunday news shows to extreme weather like California's drought and the East Coast snowstorms, according to National Journal. At least one of the shows said part of the discussion will be about climate change. On NBC, a children’s television personality known as “the science guy” will “be debating” climate change with Rep. Marcia Blackburn. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, a guest on ABC and CBS, has said global warming is "in God's hands." Sen. Bernie Sanders and eight Senate Democrats called for more climate coverage on the Sunday shows, They flagged a study by the watchdog group Media Matters for America, which found that the Sunday programs last year devoted just 27 minutes to climate change.  NSA Spying: A top-secret document, obtained by the former NSA contractor Edward J. Snowden, shows that an American law firm was monitored while representing a foreign government in trade disputes with the United States. The disclosure offers a rare glimpse of a specific instance in which Americans were ensnared by the eavesdroppers, and is of particular interest because lawyers in the United States with clients overseas have expressed growing concern that their confidential communications could be compromised by such surveillance, The New York Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Hands Off Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid: Sixteen senators told President Barack Obama on Friday not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid in his annual budget, Sen. Bernie Sanders authored the letter telling the president not to endanger the middle class and contribute to growing inequality by cutting the nation’s vital safety net, The Hill reported online. On Friday, White House press secretary Jay Carney declined to say if a cut in Social Security will be proposed again but he said the president “will continue to demonstrate his commitment to achieving additional deficit reduction.”  Don’t Cut COLAs: Sanders and 15 other senators urged Obama not to repeat a proposal from last year’s budget to lower cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security. Sen. Mary Landrieu did not sign the letter, according to The (New Orleans) Times-Picayune. Sherrod Brown, Kay Hagan and Barbara Mikluski all co-sponsored a Harkin-Sanders resolution against chained CPI last year but are not co-signers on this letter, Daily Kos noted.  Minimum Wage: An executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers was “a step forward” in a national effort to lift wages for 30 million Americans making under $10.10 per hour, Sen. Sanders told The Thom Hartmann Program on Friday. “While $10.10 is not enough unto itself for a family to live with dignity, it is a step forward, so we’re going to continue the focus to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour. There are states out there contemplating minimum wage rates higher than that, and I strongly support that,” Sanders said.  Tax Havens: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development next month plans to release a draft international taxation plan as part of an effort to cut down on offshore tax evasion. Washington’s response to tax havens has been scattershot and largely ineffective. Sen. Sanders introduced a bill that would end U.S. multinationals’ ability to defer paying taxes on foreign income. He has picked up just one co-sponsor, Sen. Brian Schatz. A companion bill by Rep. Jan Schakowsky has only three cosponsors, Congressional Quarterly reported.

The Week in Review:   Before a winter storm caked most of the eastern United States in snow and ice, the Senate on Wednesday approved House-passed legislation to pay the nation’s bills. President Obama circumvented Republicans’ unwillingness to raise the minimum wage by issuing an executive order on Wednesday declaring that federal contractors must pay at least $10.10 an hour. It was a step that Obama had been urged to take by Sen. Bernie Sanders and others in Congress. In a deal that alarmed consumer groups, Comcast on Thursday announced plans to take over Time Warner.

Dear Mr. President: Don’t Cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid:   A group of senators today urged President Barack Obama to spare Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in the budget blueprint that he will submit to Congress on March 4.A letter written by Sen. Bernie Sanders and signed by 15 other senators praised the president for improving the economy and creating jobs while reducing the deficit. In making the case against cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, however, the senators expressed concerns about retirement insecurity, growing income inequality and rising poverty.  The White House spending plan submitted to Congress one year ago proposed a cut in Social Security benefits. The president’s misguided overture to congressional Republicans would have cut future payments to retirees and disabled veterans by changing how the consumer price index is calculated. This year, the senators wrote to Obama, “We respectfully urge you not to propose cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits in your fiscal year 2015 budget.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/dear-mr-president-dont-cut-social-security-medicare-medicaid  Read the letter here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/letter-on-social-security-medicare-and-medicaid-2014?inline=file
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans: The Senate will soon consider Sen. Bernie Sanders’ comprehensive bill to improve veterans’ health care, expand educational opportunities, help the Veterans Affairs Department address a disability claims backlog and help veterans find jobs. “What I have been told is we’re next,” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press and Army Times. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will try to push forward Sanders’ wide-ranging veterans' bill when Congress returns later this month, National Journal reported. A bill that cleared Congress earlier this week repeals a provision in December’s budget agreement reducing cost-of-living adjustments for retired working-age military veterans by 1 percent.  Sanders’ bill would undo the cut for all veterans, according to The Washington Post online and Military Times. The Blaze, Glen Beck’s website, let self-styled veterans advocate Pete Hegseth claim that Sanders’ bill would load too much responsibility on the “already dysfunctional” VA.    States Ditching GDP: States are no longer relying only on the Gross Domestic Product measure as an indication of societal progress, Sean McElwee wrote for The Huffington Post. Two states, Maryland and Vermont, have officially adopted an alternative "Genuine Progress Indicator" which defines progress more holistically. "We don't need all 50 states to adopt it before it becomes clear this needs to be done at the federal level," said Sen. Sanders, who supports a federal move away from the GDP.   USPS Banks: Sen. Elizabeth Warren sees a need for small, short-term loans for people who otherwise can't get credit and she has seized on a novel idea: Transform the US Postal Service into a lender. Sen. Sanders also supports the concept, The Boston Globe reported.   Food Stamps: The farm bill just passed by Congress includes $8.6 billion in cuts over the next 10 years in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Gov. Peter Shumlin has assured Sen. Sanders that he will work with the Legislature to prevent cuts to the "heat and eat" program. Marissa Parisi, executive director of Hunger Free Vermont, says if the state doesn't step up, about 21,000 families would lose food stamps benefits worth $90 a month on average, The Colchester Sun reported.

Cable Mega-Merger:  Comcast on Thursday agreed to buy Time Warner Cable. The merger with Time Warner would create the largest cable company in America.  If the deal is approved by regulators, one company would service much of the American market. A survey of 70,000 American consumers ranked Time Warner Cable as the second worst company in America for overall customer satisfaction. Comcast was not far behind in fourth place. It’s clear that customers want more choices and increased competition in the cable television and Internet industry.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/cable-mega-merger
As you may know, since 1961 the United States of America has had no diplomatic relations with Cuba and restricts trade and travel with Cuba for the vast majority of American citizens and American businesses.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Some Military Pensions: Restored In an about face, the Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved House-passed legislation that would repeal a controversial cut to military pensions that lawmakers had approved just two months ago as part of a budget deal. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders criticized the bill as an incomplete fix, The Washington Times, The Hill and The Daily Caller reported. “While it covers the current retirees, it does not cover future retirees who would then have to bear the burden of the COLA cut,” Sanders said. Veterans organizations also raised objections to the exclusion of future retirees. A Sanders bill would repeal the full cuts and expand veterans benefits, Military.com reported.  A Raise for Low-Wage Federal Workers: President Barack Obama signed an executive order to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 for workers employed by federal contractors. Sen. Sanders told Vermont Business Magazine the president’s move “adds momentum to the push in Congress to raise the minimum wage for every worker.” In September, Sanders and 14 other senators sent a letter urging the president to issue the order, according to The Ed Schultz Show. “It was in his State of the Union speech, which I think it was very much to your credit, senator,” Schultz said during the radio interview with Sanders.  #StopTheNSA: Republicans and Democrats united Tuesday in their opposition of the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs as part of a national day of activism, The Washington Times reported. Sen. Sanders participated in the initiative by tweeting, “The NSA is out of control. #NSA #StopTheNSA.” Al-Jazeera America reported that Sen. Sanders has opposed the NSA surveillance programs.  Solar Jobs: The solar industry experienced record-breaking job growth across the nation last year, and Vermont captured the top rank for number of solar-related jobs per capita in the country, Vermont Business Magazine and the Brattleboro Reformer reported. “A dramatic expansion of solar power is a clean and economical way to help break our dependence on foreign oil, reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, and create good-paying manufacturing and installation jobs in Vermont and across the United States,” Sen. Sanders said.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/021314
Reward Hard Work:  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday praised President Barack Obama for signing an executive order raising the minimum wage for workers employed by federal contractors. “President Obama is taking a very important first step by giving a raise to hundreds of thousands of low-wage workers for federal contractors,” said Sanders, who was invited to this afternoon’s White House signing ceremony. “The president’s action adds momentum to the push in Congress to raise the minimum wage for every worker in this country to at least $10.10 an hour,” Sanders added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans: A sweeping Veterans Affairs bill from Sen. Bernie Sanders would expand veterans benefits, such as dental and medical care, education and caretaker stipends, according an online report in The Washington Post. The Veterans of Foreign Wars has thrown its support behind the Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman’s bill because it fulfills a number of VFW legislative priorities that benefit all generations of veterans and their families, Military.com reported.   Cuba: Sen. Sanders explored neighborhoods in Havana with a Cuban government official as part of a congressional delegation to the island. “I just knocked on doors and walked into peoples’ businesses and homes and just chatted,” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press. “I just wanted to get a sense of how ordinary Cubans felt about things, so I just stopped people on the street and walked into places. It was very funny. It was like I was campaigning in Havana.” Sanders also met with doctors and health care administrators and said there are lessons to be learned from Cuba’s universal healthcare system and strong emphasis on primary care.   Cuba: A majority of Americans favor normalizing relations with Cuba, according to new polling. Sen. Sanders supports reengaging with Cuba and closing the controversial Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, Vermont Public Radio, Tercera Informacion, the Missoula, Mont., Missoulian and the Hamilton, Mont., Ravalli Republic reported. “Sanders’ trip demonstrated to the Cuban leaders that times are changing in the United States,” the Times Argus said in an editorial.   Solar Power: Vermont saw the nation's largest per capita gains last year for the number of solar-related jobs, according to an industry research group. Sen. Sanders, who serves on Senate energy and environment committees, said the solar industry is central to Vermont's "bold vision" to move away from fossil fuels, vtdigger.org reported.

Sanders Calls for Limits on NSA Surveillance: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-for-limits-on-nsa-surveillance
Every Day is Veterans Day:   Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders made the case in a Senate floor speech on Tuesday for passage of the most comprehensive legislation for veterans to come before the Senate in decades.  Sanders’ bill would improve VA health care and dental care, expand educational opportunities, help the VA address a disability claims backlog and help veterans find jobs. The measure also would undo a 1 percentage point cut in annual cost-of-living adjustments for military pensions that was part of a budget agreement late last year.  It is backed by the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and many other organizations.  Watch Sen. Sanders' speech here: http://youtu.be/jKqL2ivhGO4
Americans Favor Ties with Cuba:   A majority of Americans now favor normalizing relations or engaging more directly with the Cuban government, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Atlantic Council. The survey found that 56 percent of Americans favor changing Cuba policy. In Florida, home to the nation’s largest Cuban-American community, the majority is even greater: 63 percent. “We have had an embargo for 55 years. It’s counterproductive. It’s time we normalize relations,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, just back from a weekend visit to Cuba. Sanders said lifting the embargo would benefit the economies of both countries.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans’ Pensions: The Senate on Monday took steps toward unwinding a controversial cut in veterans’ pensions. By a vote of 94-0, the Senate advanced a bill by embattled Sen. Mark Pryor that would restore a $6 billion cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees. Many Republicans have rallied around a proposal from Sen. Kelly Ayotte that would offset the $6 billion cost by closing the child tax credit to undocumented immigrants. Democrats have ranged from not wanting to offset the legislation, to looking to close offshore tax loopholes as proposed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, to a broader benefits bill from Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders that would rely on savings from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, National Journal, Marine Corps Times and military.com reported.   Veterans Benefits: Majority Leader Harry Reid plans to bring up legislation from Sen. Sanders that would restore the pension cuts and expand health care and education benefits for veterans using overseas contingency operations funds. By introducing both bills for votes this coming week, Democrats are daring Republicans to vote against retirement benefits for veterans twice, Fox News reported. Meanwhile, House Republican leaders unveiled a plan to reverse the cut to military pensions as the price for increasing the government's borrowing cap, but The Associated Press said it received a rocky reception from skeptical conservatives.   Sanders in Cuba: Sen. Bernard Sanders returned from a two-day trip to Cuba. Sanders and two other senators met with the Cuban foreign minister and Alan Gross, the imprisoned U.S. aid worker. “The goal is for us to get him out of there as soon as possible,” he said. Sanders, along with Sens. Jon Tester and Heidi Heitkamp, then flew to the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, where 155 prisoners with suspected ties to al Qaeda are locked up. Sanders remains convinced that the U.S. should shut down the prison as soon as possible, the Rutland Herald and Café Fuerte  reported.  Save the Postal Service: A congressional mandate that requires the United States Postal Service to pre-pay employee retirement benefits 75 years in advance has kept the agency from posting a profit. Sen. Bernie Sanders has introduced legislation to reverse that “onerous and unfair” burden. Sanders told MSNBC on Monday that the Postal Service must be given the flexibility in order to innovate. Pending legislation threatens to cut Saturday mail service, which could result in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs nationwide.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/021114
Postal Service Turns a Profit:  Increased revenue from its packing and shipping business boosted U.S. Postal Service revenue in the first quarter of this fiscal year.  Sen. Bernie Sanders is a leading defender of the Postal Service and has fought to save Saturday mail and prevent layoffs of thousands of workers. He talked about it on Monday with Ed Schultz on MSNBC.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans Benefits: The Senate will vote Monday on legislation from Sen. Mark Pryor, who faces a tough reelection race, to reverse $6 billion in cuts in military pensions included in the recent budget agreement. If the bill fails, as expected, the Senate is likely to proceed to a broader package from Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, National Journal reported. Majority Leader Harry Reid also is looking for an opening to bring up a proposal by Sanders to expand veterans’ health care, repeal the military-retiree COLA change and cut overseas contingency operations funds, Congressional Quarterly reported.    VA Family Care: The number of veterans who have their reproductive organs damaged in combat is growing, leading a top senator to propose legislation that would make fertility care a bigger part of Veterans Affairs hospitals' missions. Under legislation by Sen. Sanders, wounded male veterans' spouses would be able to get artificial insemination at VA hospitals, and wounded women could designate surrogate mothers who would be able to receive fertility treatment at the VA, The Washington Times reported.  "Starting a family is a two-person job," said Tom Tarantino, chief policy officer at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.   Low-Wage Workers: The number of American workers who are low-wage and low-income earners jumped 94 percent from 1979 to 2011, reaching 20.9 million workers, according to a new study from University of Massachusetts Boston economists Randy Albelda and Michael Carr. That means that 1 in 7 U.S. workers lives in a household whose main source of income is a low-paying job, such as working as a retail sales clerk or a fast-food restaurant cashier. The findings may go some way to explain why fewer Americans today identify as middle class, while those calling themselves lower or lower-middle class has jumped to 40 percent, up from only one-quarter in 2008, CBS News reported.   UPSP Banks: The post office could provide banking needs for everything from loading up a debit card to taking out a small personal loan. The idea floated by the U.S. Postal Service's inspector general is supported in theory by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. It could yield $8.9 billion a year for the post office by offering limited banking services to the tens of millions of people locked out of the current banking system due to geography or relative poverty and who often rely on payday lenders, pawnshops, and title loans for their cash, National Journal reported.

The End of Snow? - Porter Fox, The New York Times:  OVER the next two weeks, hundreds of millions of people will watch Americans like Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin ski for gold on the downhill alpine course. Television crews will pan across epic vistas of the rugged Caucasus Mountains, draped with brilliant white ski slopes. What viewers might not see is the 16 million cubic feet of snow that was stored under insulated blankets last year to make sure those slopes remained white, or the hundreds of snow-making guns that have been running around the clock to keep them that way.  Officials canceled two Olympic test events last February in Sochi after several days of temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a lack of snowfall had left ski trails bare and brown in spots. That situation led the climatologist Daniel Scott, a professor of global change and tourism at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, to analyze potential venues for future Winter Games. His thought was that with a rise in the average global temperature of more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit possible by 2100, there might not be that many snowy regions left in which to hold the Games. He concluded that of the 19 cities that have hosted the Winter Olympics, as few as 10 might be cold enough by midcentury to host them again. By 2100, that number shrinks to 6.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Food Labels: Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed an amendment to the farm bill that would have allowed states to label GMOs. That measure failed, 71-27, with Sanders blaming “all of the major biotech and food corporations in the country” for opposing it. “Well, maybe not all. One of the world’s largest food companies, General Mills, announced last month that it is now producing one of its most iconic products — Cheerios — without GMOs … The company made the change, it said, because consumers demanded it. In the end, that’s what businesses respond to,” a Valley News editorial said.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/020914

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   More Corporations Screw Workers: AOL angered employees and shined a light on a practice seeping its way into corporate America that threatens to rob workers of thousands of dollars in 401(k) savings. AOL this week switched to an annual lump sum contribution to employees’ savings plans rather than distributing the money throughout the year with every paycheck as it had done before. So anyone who leaves midyear won't see any of the pay. Companies such as Charles Schwab and Advocate Health Care handle 401(k) matches in similar ways. IBM made its change in late 2012 spurring a stern letter from Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy. They asked IBM to reconsider its decision, The Washington Post reported.  Sanders Visits Cuba: Sen. Sanders is traveling in Cuba this weekend to discuss human rights, trade, and health care issues as part of a congressional delegation, MSNBC, WCAX-TV, New England Cable News and Martí Noticias reported. The delegation on Saturday will visit the controversial military prison at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/020814
The Week in Review:   Sen. Bernie Sanders was in Havana, Cuba, on Friday as part of a congressional delegation. The itinerary included a Saturday visit to military prison at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. There was another disappointing jobs report on Friday when the Labor Department said real unemployment in January was 12.7 percent.  The bad news came one day after Senate Republicans once again blocked an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. A five-year farm bill was passed by the Senate on Tuesday. It will cut nearly $9 billion in food stamps at a time when poverty in the United States is at an all-time high. And as sports fans around the world focused on the Winter Olympics, Sanders placed a statement in Friday’s Congressional Record praising a big delegation of Vermont athletes representing the United States in Sochi, Russia.

Vermont Olympians:   As the winter games got underway, Sen. Bernie Sanders congratulated Vermonters who will be representing the United States. “Vermont has a long tradition of excellence in winter sports that we owe partly to our state’s cold climate and mountainous terrain, but also to an outdoor spirit that dates back generations,” Sanders said in a statement in the Congressional Record.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-congratulates-vermont-olympians
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders in Cuba: Sen. Bernie Sanders departed Thursday on a congressional delegation trip to Havana, Cuba, and the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base to discuss human rights, trade, and health care issues, WFFF-TV, WVNY-TV in Burlington, Vt., and WNYT-TV in Albany, N.Y., reported. “The prison at Guantánamo Bay has significantly damaged the United States’ moral standing, undermined our foreign policy, and encouraged terrorism rather than effectively combated it,” Sanders said ahead of the trip. “We should aggressively defend ourselves against terrorism, but we must do so in a way that is consistent with our nation’s core values.”   Food Labels: The food industry and farm groups are pushing Congress to pass legislation that would require the Food and Drug Administration to create a federal standard for voluntary labels on food products, thereby invalidating state laws requiring labeling of genetically modified ingredients. Last May, the Senate rejected an initiative by Sen. Sanders that would have allowed states to require labeling of genetically modified foods, The Associated Press reported.   Tax Breaks for Big Oil: Large oil companies are taking advantage of tax breaks that allow them to write off expenses for cleaning up damaging oil spills. Rep. Keith Ellison told MSNBC on Thursday that Sen. Sanders and he proposed legislation that would cancel these tax breaks and others for the nation’s largest polluters.   Senate to Take Up Sanders’ Veterans Bill: Sen. Sanders has introduced a comprehensive veterans bill backed by more than 20 veterans' service organizations, National Public Radio and Stars & Stripes reported. Aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he hopes to move next week on the Sanders bill which would expand veterans’ health care, repeal a military-retiree COLA change and cut overseas contingency operations funds, Congressional Quarterly reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/020714
Republicans Again Block Help for Long-Term Unemployed: A bill to revive benefits for the long-term unemployed was blocked on Thursday by Senate Republicans. The proposed three-month extension of the jobless-aid program, which expired Dec. 28, was supported by Sen. Bernie Sanders and all of the other members of the Democratic caucus. Only four Republican senators supported the measure. One more vote would have provided the 60 needed under Senate rules to advance the bill.  Since Christmas, unemployment benefits have now expired for 1.6 million Americans out of work for longer than 26 weeks. Unless Congress acts, the same fate awaits another 1.6 million people nationwide during the first half of 2014.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans Bill Would Undo Military Pension Cuts: Legislation by Sen. Bernie Sanders would restore full funding for military retiree pensions and expand veterans’ benefits, WCAX-TV and Military Times reported. In a front page article, The Washington Post cited aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid saying the Senate will soon bring forward Sanders’ legislation to restore the benefit cuts. Sen. Richard Burr plans to introduce a Republican alternative to Sanders' bill, because he doesn't think Sanders' legislation can pass the House. The Senate Armed Services Committee will address the military pensions issue on Monday as it considers legislation by Sens. Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan, National Journal reported.   VA Benefits Backlog: As veterans come home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they are facing significant delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs, an agency that has struggled to upgrade its aged paper system to digital, Politico reported. The total number of backlogged VA claims has dropped more than 35 percent since it peaked in March. Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate veterans committee, said the department is  finally “in the process now of undertaking something that should have been done years ago.”   Sanders Supports USPS Banking: The Postal Service should be allowed to find innovative new ways to shore up its finances including offering limited banking services to customers, Sen. Sanders told The Ed Schultz Show. “We need to give the Postal Service the tools it needs - not just in banking but in a number of other areas - to serve the needs of the America people.”   The Koch Brothers Party: Sen. Sanders lamented the rise of a third party in national and state politics - the Koch Brothers party - on The Thom Hartmann Program Wednesday. As wealthy donors pour millions into the political process following the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, Sanders said the political money "affects every single issue" and "undermines the very foundations of our American democracy." Sanders called for public financing of elections.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/020614
Banking on the Postal Service:   Sen. Bernie Sanders has fought cuts in service by the U.S. Postal Service.  He’s also sponsored legislation to let the Postal Service find innovative new ways to shore up its finances. A new report from the Postal Service suggests one way the agency could make as much as $8.9 billion in annual revenue would be to offer limited banking services like cashing checks and selling pre-paid debit cards. The USPS already takes in more than $100 million in revenue each year by selling postal money orders. “One of the areas we should be looking at is banking,” Sanders told Ed Schultz in a radio interview on Wednesday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans Flanked by more than 20 veterans groups, Senate Veterans: Affairs Chairman Bernie Sanders on Tuesday urged quick Senate passage of legislation that would repeal $6 billion in military pension cuts and enhance veterans’ health benefits, according to The Hill, The Washington Post online, The Washington Times, Military Times and the Burlington Free Press. “What this legislation is about is keeping promises and getting our priorities right,” Sanders said. The $24 billion measure is paid for with savings from the drawdown in Afghanistan and Iraq.   Senate Sends Farm Bill to White House: In a 68-32 vote, the Senate passed the first comprehensive farm package since 2008 by approving a five-year agreement Tuesday which is expected to be signed into law by the president, The Associated Press, Rutland Herald and Burlington Free Press reported. Sen. Sanders said the bill will bring greater stability to Vermont dairy farmers and also encourage increased access to healthy, local foods. But he faulted the bill for cutting the nutrition assistance by $8.6 billion during the next decade. On MSNBC, Lawrence O’Donnell called the farm bill “bad socialism” and “the only kind of socialism that could unite liberal socialist Bernie Sanders with Republican agricultural socialist David Vitter.”  Tar Sands Pipeline: Secretary of State John Kerry, who has fashioned himself as a leading environmentalist throughout his political career, must now recommend to President Obama whether or not to approve of the Keystone XL pipeline. Sen. Sanders, who opposes the pipeline, said he will be calling Kerry to discuss his environmental concerns. “The issue is now in the lap of the Secretary of State John Kerry,” Sanders said in an interview with The Boston Globe. “Given his pronouncements when he was senator, I think it's a no-brainer to suggest that this pipeline should not go forward.”   NSA ‘Probably” Spies on Congress: Deputy Attorney General James Cole told the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that the National Security Agency “probably” collects information about phone calls made by members of Congress. Sen. Sanders previously asked the agency whether or not it has snooped on members of Congress, The Hill and Russia Today noted. Tuesday’s admission may mark the first time the government has responded in the affirmative, according to National Journal. The push for NSA reform has united members of Congress on the left and right, according to Reason.com.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/020514
Veterans Back Benefits Bill:   Leaders of more than 20 veterans’ service organizations today joined Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders at a news conference to support the most comprehensive legislation for veterans in decades.  The bill (S. 1982) is backed by the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and many other organizations.  “This bill is the result of a great deal of bipartisan work to address issues raised during congressional hearings in which many of these organizations testified before joint sessions of the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees,” Sander said. “In my view, this is the most comprehensive piece of veterans’ legislation to be offered in decades and addresses many of the challenges facing service members, veterans and their families.”   The package – which the Senate could take up as early as Thursday – would improve VA health care and dental care, expand educational opportunities, help the VA address a disability claims backlog and help veterans find jobs. The measure also would undo a 1 percentage point cut in annual cost-of-living adjustments for military pensions that was part of a budget agreement late last year.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans Bill in Senate: The Senate is gearing up to vote on a bill by Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders that would repeal a pension cut for military retirees and expand veterans’ health care and other benefits, Talk Radio News Service reported. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said she was encouraged by Sanders' expansive bill for veterans, the Watertown (N.Y.) Daily Times reported. Sanders' bill is financed by money designated to pay for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to a Daily Kos blog.   House Bill to Help Veterans Pay Tuition Advances: The House passed legislation on Monday that would require public universities to charge veterans in-state tuition rates or face a financial penalty. A similar proposal is included in Sen. Sanders's omnibus veterans' legislation, but National Journal said Sanders’ bill “got some quick pushback from a Republican aide with the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, who noted that members prefer a piecemeal approach.”   Farm Bill: Congress is on the verge of overhauling federal farm policies and reforming how the government helps poor people pay for their groceries. While lamenting cuts in food stamps, Vermont officials are pleased that the new farm bill protects dairy farmers. “The fact that we got a farm bill is a miracle, it’s really a testament to our congressional delegation — Pat Leahy, Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch,” Gov. Peter Shumlin said during a visit to the Bennington Banner on Monday. The Addison County Independent said farmers were grateful for the delegation’s work.   Genuine Progress Indicator: Many states are working on alternatives to the Gross Domestic Product, which measures the market value of all goods produced. Vermont and Maryland have adopted one such measure, a Genuine Progress Indicator, which assesses economic, social, and environmental progress. Sen. Sanders told The New Republic that such state-level initiatives are “enormously important” in prodding the federal government into action.

A Monday evening vigil outside the White House was among more than 200 demonstrations planned across the country by leading environmentalists opposed to construction of Canada’s controversial tar sands oil pipeline. President Obama will have the final say on whether to allow building the 1,200 mile pipeline to ship 830,000 barrels a day of the dirty crude oil from Alberta to refineries in Texas along the Gulf of Mexico coast.  An environmental impact study released on Friday discounted the increase in greenhouse gas emissions that would result from extracting and refining more of the dirtiest form of crude oil on the planet. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the report “turned a blind eye to the ugly reality” that expanded drilling in the tar sands region would contribute to global warming. President Obama should block construction of the pipeline, Sanders said, to avoid contributing to “the most serious environmental crisis facing the world today.” In addition to the vigil outside the White House, another was planned Monday evening in New York featuring 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben. The Vermont-based McKibben’s 350.org helped organize the vigils along with CREDO, the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network and other organizations.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans: The Senate this week could take up a bill by Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Bernard Sanders to expand veterans’ health care and also repeal a 1 percentage point cut to the annual adjustment for military retirees included in the new budget deal. Supporters say it would be paid for with cuts in overseas contingency operations funds for the Pentagon and other agencies, Congressional Quarterly and National Journal reported.   Farm Bill: The Senate today is expected to draw closer to clearing a new House-passed farm bill that was nearly three years in the making. “This is a huge and complicated bill which has some very positive provisions but also some negative ones,” Sen. Sanders said in a Bennington Banner editorial. “The good news is that this legislation provides support for family-based dairy farmers in Vermont and throughout the country. The bad news is that it makes harmful cuts in nutrition programs.”   NSA Spying: The National Security Agency is collecting everything from text messages to Google map pins and cell phone records without probable cause from millions of Americans who have never committed a crime, vtdigger.org reported. Sen. Sanders asked. “How do we protect people from a terrorist attack, but do it in a way that does not undermine our democracy and the privacy rights that make us a free country?”   Climate Change: “Sen. Sanders is a vocal advocate in the push to combat climate change. He has introduced … legislation that aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels … [He] is willing to take on the special interest polluters and work with his peers to protect our health and preserve our planet for future generations,” Brian Shupe, the Vermont Natural Resource Council executive director, wrote in a letter to the editor of the Burlington Free Press.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Revolving Door: Federal ethics rules are intended to limit lobbying by former senior officials within one year after they leave the government. Yet even after the ethics rules were revised in 2007 following a lobbying scandal, more than 1,650 congressional aides have registered to lobby within a year of leaving Capitol Hill, according to an analysis by The New York Times.  NSA Spying: It was a packed house at the Montpelier City Hall Saturday as Sen. Bernie Sanders held a town meeting about constitutional rights and privacy. Sanders focused his talk on the National Security Agency’s surveillance of telephone and email records, according to reports.  NSA Spying: David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, said the NSA’s collection of the cellphone records of Americans should be a matter of concern to everyone because the government conducted it in secret and invaded people’s privacy. Heidi Boghosian, the National Lawyers Guild executive director, said corporations are also collecting vast amounts of data. Rep. Peter Welch, part of Sanders’ Saturday panel, said the U.S. has been living a “bizarre reality” since 9/11 in which the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies are operating under secret budgets, the Vermont Press Bureau reported in the Times Argus and Rutland Herald.  Tar Sands Pipeline: Vermont's two U.S. senators sharply criticized an environmental impact statement from the U.S. State Department that appears to support construction of the hotly debated Keystone oil pipeline from Canada to Texas. Both Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy say the pipeline would enable a big increase in oil production and add to greenhouse gas emissions blamed for climate change, The Associated Press reported on Saturday.

The Week in Review:  Putting an emphasis on economic inequality in America, President Obama used Tuesday’s State of the Union address to announce that he would act without Congress to raise the minimum wage for workers employed by companies awarded federal contracts.  Sen. Bernie Sanders and 14 other senators had urged Obama to do just that. Sanders on Saturday hosted a town meeting in Montpelier, Vt., on how the National Security Agency and corporations are undermining Americans’ privacy rights. And Friday’s big news for big oil was that a State Department environmental impact study found no reason to prevent construction of the tar sands oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.  Sanders urged Obama to block the pipeline project.  Continue reading The Week in Review: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-013114

Rep. Peter Welch will participate.  Tar Sands Pipeline: The State Department released a report on Friday concluding that the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution. In the Burlington Free Press, Sen. Sanders said the study “turns a blind eye to the ugly reality” that tar sands extraction and refining releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. “President Obama should block construction of the Keystone pipeline,” added Sanders, a member of the Senate environment and energy committees. On Twitter, Sanders said that "no one who is serious about reversing global warming could support the pipeline,” Newsmax reported.  Veterans Clinic Opens: Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, spoke at the grand opening Friday of the Lakeside Clinic for veterans, the Burlington Free Press reported. “In the last couple of years we’ve seen new clinics in Rutland, in Newport in Brattleboro.

Sanders on Friday called for a “major jobs program to put millions of people back to work” on jobs like rebuilding the nation’s “crumbling infrastructure.” In a wide-ranging interview with WCAX-TV, Sanders also advocated for a higher minimum wage that could lift Americans out of poverty and lower the deficit with fewer families relying on government assistance.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  State Dept. Report Due on Oil Pipeline: The State Department today plans to release a much-anticipated environmental review on the Keystone XL pipeline. “No one who is serious about reversing global warming could support the #KeystoneXL pipeline," Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Twitter on Tuesday morning before President Obama's State of the Union address, Politico reported.   Vermont Yankee Shutdown: Sen. Sanders wants states to have a greater oversight role in decommissioning nuclear power plants. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairwoman Allison Macfarlane told Sanders and his fellow members of the Senate environment committee that NRC rules allow a local advisory board to offer input on the decommissioning process. Sanders wants to give states more authority. The issue has arisen in Vermont since Vermont Yankee nuclear plant owner Entergy Corp. announced last summer that the plant would close at the end of 2014, The Associated Press and Brattleboro Reformer, WCAX-TV, WVNY-TV and WPTZ-TV reported.   Home Heating Help for Vermont: The state was granted $2.5 million more in federal money for heating assistance. Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch said “any relief is welcome” for families in the state struggling to heat their homes but pledged to press for additional help for low-income Vermonters struggling to pay for heating costs, according to an AP report in the Bennington Banner.  Farm Bill Cuts Food Stamps: A $100-billion-per-year compromise farm bill passed the House by a vote of 251-166. The bill contains cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program known as food stamps but leaves intact most crop subsidies. A Brattleboro Reformer editorial quoted Sen. Sanders assessment of the bill.  "The good news is that this legislation provides support for family-based dairy farmers in Vermont and throughout the country. The bad news is that it makes harmful cuts in nutrition programs.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/013114

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama’s ‘Modest’ Agenda: Sen. Bernie Sanders called President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address “modest” and added, during an interview on The Ed Schultz Show, that the president missed opportunities to speak about campaign finance reform and other important issues. NBC’s chief White House correspondent, Chuck Todd, on MSNBC called Obama’s address a speech that “both Bernie Sanders and Mark Pryor could agree on.” Sanders welcomed the president’s focus on reducing inequality and helping working families, WCAX-TV reported.   Senate Poised to Take up Veterans Bill: Democrats and Republicans are united in their pledge to repeal a $6 billion cut to veterans’ benefits that Congress enacted as part of December's budget deal. Sen. Sanders, the Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman, is pushing a broad measure that would restore veterans' pensions and expand access to health care and educational benefits. He got a leg up on other proposals on Wednesday when Majority Leader Harry Reid took steps to put that legislation in line for Senate debate. And Sen. Dick Durbin, Reid's right-hand man, said he anticipated Sanders's bill would move to the floor soon, National Journal reported.   House Passes Farm Bill: The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill authorizing nearly $1 trillion in spending on farm subsidies and nutrition programs, setting the stage for final passage of a new five-year farm bill that has been stalled for more than two years. Negotiators worked out their differences on cuts to food stamps and a price support program for dairy farmers. Sen. Sanders said the bill contained both positives and negatives, noting the more than $8 billion in devastating cuts to nutrition programs, WAMC-FM reported.   USPS: The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing Wednesday on postal reform legislation by Sens. Tom Carper and Tom Coburn, the panel’s chairman and ranking member. Carper said the measure includes provisions to help the Postal Service identify potential new sources of revenue. “A tip of the hat to the Sen. Sanders and others who have worked on innovation and entrepreneur side,” Carper added during a statement broadcast on C-SPAN.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Calls in State of the Union for Year of Action: Sen. Bernie Sanders said addressing growing wealth and income inequality in American must be a central part of President Barack Obama’s agenda in the coming year. “The American economy is not sustainable when so few have so much and so many have so little,” Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC ahead of the speech. “It’s a moral issue and it’s an economic issue, because if people don’t have money to spend, you don’t create jobs.”   Minimum Wage: President Obama announced in his annual speech to a joint session of Congress that he will sign an executive order to raise the wages of hundreds of thousands of workers for federal government contractors. Sen. Sanders and other progressives have long pushed for the move, according to USA Today, The Washington Post online, The Wall Street Journal, McClatchy Washington Bureau, The Nation, MSNBC, Politico, The Huffington Post, Daily Kos and Common Dreams.   Trade Deal: Some Democrats said the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact had no place in a State of the Union address centered on income inequality. Sen. Sanders said the president should "think long and hard about extending this TPP trade agreement,” which he said “is not going to be good for working families," according to The Huffington Post.   State of the Union: In what's become a rite of winter in Washington, lawmakers crossed the aisle and political polar opposites, like Sanders and Jeff Sessions, stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the crowded House chamber, National Journal blogged.  Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she sat next to Sessions and Sanders. “I will tell you that he stood and cheered when we talked about people having the right to vote,” Klobuchar told Rachel Maddow afterward on MSNBC. In the hours before the big speech, Sanders and other senators gathered for their traditional pre-speech dinner of chicken pot pie, dilled shrimp, black-eyed peas and asparagus, The Washington Post blogged.

A Victory for Workers:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday welcomed a White House announcement that President Obama will sign an executive order setting the minimum wage for workers under new federal contracts at $10.10 an hour. The White House also said the president would discuss the issue in tonight’s State of the Union address.  “I applaud President Obama for issuing this executive order which will raise wages for hundreds of thousands of low-wage workers. The president has made it clear that employees working for government contractors should not be paid starvation wages. This executive order also gives us momentum for raising the minimum wage for every worker in this country to at least $10.10 an hour,” Sanders said.  “I applaud President Obama for issuing this executive order which will raise wages for hundreds of thousands of low-wage workers. The president has made it clear that employees working for government contractors should not be paid starvation wages. This executive order also gives us momentum for raising the minimum wage for every worker in this country to at least $10.10 an hour,” Sanders said.  The senator in September sent a letter to the president urging him to issue an executive order to setting a minimum wage for federal contractors. Sanders also is a cosponsor of Senate legislation to raise the minimum wage for all workers to $10.10 from the current $7.25 an hour.  Watch Sanders discuss the minimum wage on C-SPAN's Washington Journal: http://youtu.be/lo_TgR__SVQ
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Minimum Wage: President Barack Obama will announce during Tuesday night’s State of the Union address that he's raising the minimum wage for workers under federal contracts to $10.10 per hour, The Huffington Post reported. The move marks a significant victory for labor unions and a handful of progressive Democrats who pressed the president to issue the order, including Reps. Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva and Sen. Bernie Sanders. The new policy, to be instituted via executive order, may affect hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs are supported by federal dollars. Fifteen senators, led by Sanders, sent a letter to the president urging him to exercise his executive authority to raise the minimum wage, Politico reported.  Minimum Wage: An analysis by the Employment Policies Institute found that 96 percent of House and Senate sponsors of the minimum wage bill do not pay their interns, according to FoxNews.com. Sen. Sanders is the only sponsor who pays all of his interns, the Washington Examiner reported.  Income Inequality: Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Monday that providing a quality education to every American should be a top priority to reduce poverty. “We should learn from many other countries that understand that education is an investment, and that every kid in this country regardless of income should have educational opportunity.” At one point, Sanders accused Bachmann of wanting to cut Social Security. “That’s absolutely a lie,” Bachmann responded, not mentioning that in 2010 she called the program “a tremendous fraud” in 2010 and supported Rep. Paul Ryan’s program in 2011 that called for doing just that, The Raw Story reported.  Sanders Signs Supreme Court Brief in Birth Control Case: In a brief to be filed with the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, 18 Democratic senators and an independent, Sanders, side with the Obama administration against evangelical Christian businessmen who argue that paying for their employees’ birth control, a requirement under Obamacare, violates their company’s religious freedom. The senators—five of them women—argue in their “friend of the court” brief that the owners of the Oklahoma-based crafts store chain Hobby Lobby are not exempt from the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate simply because some forms of birth control offend their religious beliefs, Yahoo News reported.

Sen. Sanders talks about the president's State of the Union Address: http://youtu.be/46R9mpKxdCA
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Income Inequality: The United States has the 4th-highest wealth inequality in the world, according to "Inequality for All,” a film by former Labor Secretary Robert Reich that was featured at a special showing Sunday in South Burlington, Vt. "It's a moral issue. We are seeing a middle class disappearing, more people living in poverty than any time in the history of this country and yet the top 1 percent is doing phenomenally well," Sen. Bernie Sanders said on WCAX-TV.   State of the Union: Sen. Sanders told Politico he hopes President Obama uses Tuesday’s State of the Union address to make clear he will not cut programs for working families. “I hope that the president will make it very clear that when the middle class is struggling and we have more people today living in poverty than any time in American history, that we are not going to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.”   State of the Union: As the president prepares his State of the Union speech, environmental advocates say he should use the speech to reaffirm his commitment to action on climate change.  “I hope that he would be as forceful as he can to make it clear that we are facing a global crisis, that bold action is needed, and that the United States can and should lead the way on this issue,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee. “When you are addressing what the scientific community believes is the greatest crisis facing our planet you have got to make it a major, major priority. You just can’t walk away from it,” Sen. Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.   Veterans: A wide-ranging bill to help veterans could come up soon before the Senate. The bill that Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders plans to introduce aims to expand health care and dental care for veterans as well as access to education benefits. It would also void the recent 1 percent cut in cost-of-living benefits for working-age military retirees, AP Radio News reported on WBBM-AM, Chicago’s all-news radio, KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh and other stations.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Unemployment: Nearly 1,300 New Hampshire residents and 650 Vermonters were among 1.3 million Americans whose extended unemployment benefits stopped at the end of 2013. State employment agencies are still trying to count the number of unemployed who are joining or soon will join their ranks once they reach their 26th week of state unemployment relief. Sen. Bernie Sanders said another compromise bill could reach the Senate floor this week, but six or seven Republicans would be needed to achieve the 60 votes required to forestall a filibuster. “When President (George W.) Bush was in office, we extended (benefits) five times,” Sanders said. “Five times. Now that Obama is president, the Republicans are against it unless it is ‘paid for.’ They want to gut the Affordable Care Act, child-care tax credits, Social Security disability,” Sanders told the Valley News.  Veterans: A bill that Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders has introduced aims to extend health care and dental care for veterans as well as access to education,” WBZ-AM in Boston reported. It would also avoid the recent 1 percent cut in cost-of-living benefits for working-age military retirees. As for covering the roughly $30 billion dollar cost, Sanders wants to tap the fund used to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hopes to bring the measure to the Senate floor as soon as possible.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/012614
Tomorrow: Please join Sen. Bernie Sanders for a special showing of the new film with Robert Reich. The United States has the highest level of income and wealth inequality of any developed country in the world. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the financial wealth of the nation, while the bottom 60 percent owns all of 2.3 percent. This is an issue that must be discussed.  This free film will be followed by a town meeting to discuss the issue of income inequality, what it means for the future of our society, and what we can do to make a difference. Sen. Sanders will lead a panel discussion with audience participation.  Free bagels and coffee at 10 a.m. Film begins at 10:30 a.m.  Read more here: https://www.facebook.com/events/596751060378247/

State of the Union: http://youtu.be/46R9mpKxdCA
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   State of the Union: President Barack Obama will devote part of his State of the Union address on Tuesday to income inequality in America. On The Thom Hartmann Program Friday, Sen. Bernie Sanders compared today’s income and wealth inequality to levels before the Great Depression. “Clearly, the president has got to lay out a series of proposals which … pay attention to the working families of this country,” Sanders told MSNBC’s Ed Schultz on Friday. “We`ve got to address the crisis of unemployment which means extending unemployment benefits, which means raising the minimum wage, which means creating a jobs program which deals with the fact that 20 percent of our young people are unemployed …."    State of the Union: A junior at Mount Anthony Union High School in Bennington, Vt., has won Sen. Bernie Sanders' annual State of the Union essay-writing contest. Alexina Federhen took first place out of 380 students from 26 Vermont high schools who participated. The students wrote about how they view the state of the union, according to an Associated Press report in the Burlington Free Press, Times Argus, Rutland Herald and Brattleboro Reformer.   Inequality for All: Sen. Sanders on Sunday will host a free screening of “Inequality for All,” a film that addresses the widening wealth and income gaps in the U.S., the Burlington Free Press reported. Sanders will moderate a discussion after the screening which will include the film's creator - former Sec. of Labor Robert Reich. Reich and Sanders have been preaching the same progressive gospel for years, according to Vermont Public Radio and the Times Argus. “In the 30 or more years that I’ve been working on this problem, I have not seen more action and discussion,” Reich told VPR by phone from California.   Wealth Gap: Sen. Sanders has said that “nearly six out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the U.S." He accurately reported the results of a longstanding question by Gallup, according to Politifact, which rated the statement "true."

The Week in Review:   Looking ahead to Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday discussed issues he hopes President Obama puts front and center in the annual speech to a special joint session of Congress.  The speech is widely expected to focus on income and wealth inequality, a topic Sanders has focused on for years.  The senator has urged Obama to use his executive powers to effectively raise the minimum wage for workers employed by federal contractors. He also has been a leader in trying to extend unemployment benefits for those out of a job for six months or more. Sanders discussed those and other issues during his weekly radio, television and Internet appearance on The Thom Hartmann Program. Watch the show.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: If Congress won't raise the federal minimum wage, President Obama can, at least for people who work for companies that get federal contracts, subcontracts and grants. So says a group of liberals in the House and Senate who want Obama to sign an executive order requiring federal agencies to give preference in awarding contracts to companies that pay workers no less than $10.10 an hour. Fifteen senators, led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and 17 members of the House, led by Keith Ellison of Minnesota, sent letters to the president urging him to exercise his executive authority. Currently the federal minimum wage is $7.25. And there's been a push by Democrats to raise it to $10.10 -- an idea that Obama supports. The White House hasn't taken a position on whether Obama would issue an executive order, CNN Money reported.   NSA Surveillance: A federal privacy watchdog panel on Thursday pronounced the National Security Agency archiving of telephone metadata — numbers, times and lengths of calls, but not their content — an invasion of privacy that's of "limited value" in counter-terrorism cases. In a major speech outlining his agenda to reform NSA surveillance, Obama last week pressed for a plan to move the phone records out of the government’s control. But, unlike the watchdog group, he did not call for an end to the program. “The president's recommendations last week did not go far enough to rein in the out-of-control National Security Agency,” Sen. Sanders said in the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. The report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board “underscores that the collection of records on virtually every phone call made in the United States is an unconstitutional violation of the privacy rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment,” Sanders said in The Hill.   Veterans: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said the Senate will soon take up legislation to restore pension benefits for military retirees while expanding other programs and services for veterans, Vermont Public Radio and Brattleboro Reformer reported. Stars and Stripes and Military.com reported that Democrats "aren’t sure yet how to pay for or whether Republicans will support it."  Sanders’ bill is “the most comprehensive and complete veterans' bill in recent history, covering everything from health care to education to employment to disability claims,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal said, according to The (New London, Conn.) Day.   Trans-Pacific Partnership: The Trans-Pacific Partnership threatens to undo advances made by states and localities to reduce their carbon footprint, The (Williston Park, N.Y.) Island Now reported. “I have the same concerns as with NAFTA and even more with this,” Sen. Sanders said. “It’s being negotiated virtually in secret."  Continue reading here.

Sanders Says Congress Must Act on Privacy Panel Report: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-says-congress-must-act-on-privacy-panel-report
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Watchdog Report Says N.S.A. Program Is Illegal and Should End: An independent federal privacy watchdog has concluded that the National Security Agency’s program to collect bulk phone call records has provided only “minimal” benefits in counterterrorism efforts, is illegal and should be shut down. The findings are laid out in a 238-page report, scheduled for release by Thursday and obtained by The New York Times, that represent the first major public statement by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which Congress made an independent agency in 2007 and only recently became fully operational.  Senate to Take Up Major Overhaul of Veterans Benefits: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders told reporters Wednesday that a massive veterans’ bill would improve education, health and employment benefits for former troops. The legislation also would restore the cost-of-living adjustment reduction for military retirees set by the Bipartisan Budget Act, The Washington Post reported online.  Income Inequality: The richest 85 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the planet’s population, according to a new study cited by Sen. Sanders during an interview Wednesday on The Ed Schultz Show. "What we need to do in Congress and we need to it all over this world is say, 'Wait a second - this world, this planet, doesn’t belong to just a few people.’ The wealth of this world has got to be enjoyed by everybody, and we need policies to make that happen," Sanders said.  Net Neutrality: A swift response to reclassify broadband Internet as a telecommunications service can preserve a free internet after a federal court struck down key net neutrality regulations this month, The (Madison, Wis.) Capital Times reported. Sen. Sanders called the court’s ruling "a blow to consumers and small businesses alike," and added that without regulatory safeguards, "corporations are able to prioritize the information available to users, it stifles ideas and expression, as well as commerce and innovation.”  Continue reading the news: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/012314
Sanders Details Sweeping Veterans Legislation:   U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, told reporters today that the Senate is expected to soon take up legislation to restore pensions for military retirees as part of the most comprehensive veterans’ legislation to come before the Senate in decades.  The measure that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has called a top priority for the Senate also would address a host of other programs for veterans, including expanded health care and dental care and improved education benefits.  Sanders (I-Vt.) told a news conference that the measure would rescind a 1 percentage point cut in the annual adjustment for benefits for military retirees under age 62.  There has been a groundswell in Congress to undo that provision in the bipartisan budget deal that Congress approved late last year.  Other provisions address long-standing concerns of veterans’ and military service organizations and “deliver on the promises that we have made to our service members,” the chairman said.  The bill has garnered support from virtually every major veterans’ group in the country, Sanders added.  “This massive omnibus bill, unprecedented in our modern experience, would create, expand, advance, and extend a number of VA benefits, services and programs that are important to DAV and to our members,” wrote Joseph W. Johnston, National Commander of the Disabled American Veterans, which represents 1.2 million service-connected disabled veterans who were wounded, injured or became ill while in military service.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veterans: The Senate will consider a proposal to restore $6 billion in cuts to working-age military retiree pensions, The Hill and Salem Radio Network on KUIK-AM in Portland, Ore. reported. The proposal is part of an omnibus veterans’ bill introduced Thursday by Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders. “The American people have spoken very loudly and very clearly. They have told the Congress to restore those cuts to military retirees and we have listened,” Sanders said.    Obama to Meet Pope: A decision to visit Pope Francis at the Vatican in late March provides President Obama with an opportunity to highlight the problem of economic inequality. “Clearly, the pope and the president have their differences,” but widening inequality clearly troubles both of them, Sen. Sanders said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. “It is a moral issue, and once we begin to look at those issues from a moral perspective, it demands political solutions.”   Minimum Wage: President Barack Obama told his Cabinet this month he would not resign himself to "waiting for legislation" from a gridlocked Congress in order to push his agenda, The president could move the ball forward by announcing a few dramatic actions at his State of the Union address this month. Sen. Sanders and other progressive leaders have urged the president to issue an executive order that would ensure that taxpayer dollars go only to federal contractors that pay their employees a living wage, Katrina vanden Heuvel wrote for The Washington Post online.   Food Banks Prepare for Food Stamp Cuts: Even greater demands on food banks are expected as Congress prepares to cut billions of dollars more from the food stamp program. About 47 million Americans receive food stamps. A compromise farm bill is expected to cut about $9 billion from food stamps over 10 years. House Republicans had wanted to trim financing by $40 billion over the same period, and a bipartisan Senate bill sought a $4 billion cut. But House members, most of them Republicans, may be unwilling to pass a bill that includes anything less than the $40 billion cut. And senators, especially Democrats, may see the compromise measure as going too far. President Obama has threatened to veto any bill that cuts too deeply, The New York Times reported.

Citizens United: Four years ago today the Supreme Court gutted campaign finance laws and lifted limits on corporate campaign cash. On Jan. 21, 2010, Sen. Bernie Sanders predicted that the ruling would “give control of the political process in the United States to the wealthiest and most powerful institutions in the world and the candidates who support their agenda. Instead of democracy being about one-person one-vote, it will now be about the size of a company’s bank account.”
 
 The 5-to-4 decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission  led to rulings that let wealthy individuals like the billionaires Charles and David Koch pour unlimited and unregulated sums into campaign coffers.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: Sen. Bernie Sanders has joined Senate colleagues in forming a new task force to highlight climate change. The Senate Climate Action Task Force questioned why the issue hasn’t gotten more attention on Sunday morning news programs. Sanders pointed to a study by the media watchdog group Media Matters for America, which found that during 2012 the news shows devoted a total of 8 minutes to climate change, according to an Associated Press report in the Rutland Herald and on WPTZ-TV on Monday and Tuesday.   NSA Spying: “The president really faces some challenges in Congress. He's not only up against opposition in his own party, from Bernie Sanders, but Rand Paul and others in the Republican Party. They're almost forming a new coalition that's really going to push back I think against the president's recommendations,” Robert Costa of The Washington Post said on Fox News Sunday.  MLK Day: Sen. Sanders spoke at an event marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Burlington, Vt. “King had incredible courage. He led the fight [against] segregation but also said that every child in this country, every person in this country was entitled to health care, to education, to jobs, to decent wages. Let's never forget,” Sanders said in a report broadcast Monday on WCAX-TV.   Bad Trade Deal: The Trans Pacific Partnership — a new secret international trade agreement — will dramatically expand the rights of international corporations over those of … consumers, workers, and the environment. Contact Sens. Leahy and Sanders and Congressman Welch before it’s too late, and ask them to vote against the TPP “fast track.” Margaret Blanchard wrote in a letter to the editor of the Times Argus.

Must Read: For the Love of Money - Sam Polk, The New York Times:   IN my last year on Wall Street my bonus was $3.6 million — and I was angry because it wasn’t big enough. I was 30 years old, had no children to raise, no debts to pay, no philanthropic goal in mind. I wanted more money for exactly the same reason an alcoholic needs another drink: I was addicted.  Eight years earlier, I’d walked onto the trading floor at Credit Suisse First Boston to begin my summer internship. I already knew I wanted to be rich, but when I started out I had a different idea about what wealth meant. I’d come to Wall Street after reading in the book “Liar’s Poker” how Michael Lewis earned a $225,000 bonus after just two years of work on a trading floor. That seemed like a fortune. Every January and February, I think about that time, because these are the months when bonuses are decided and distributed, when fortunes are made.  I’d learned about the importance of being rich from my dad. He was a modern-day Willy Loman, a salesman with huge dreams that never seemed to materialize. “Imagine what life will be like,” he’d say, “when I make a million dollars.” While he dreamed of selling a screenplay, in reality he sold kitchen cabinets. And not that well. We sometimes lived paycheck to paycheck off my mom’s nurse-practitioner salary.  Dad believed money would solve all his problems. At 22, so did I. When I walked onto that trading floor for the first time and saw the glowing flat-screen TVs, high-tech computer monitors and phone turrets with enough dials, knobs and buttons to make it seem like the cockpit of a fighter plane, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. It looked as if the traders were playing a video game inside a spaceship; if you won this video game, you became what I most wanted to be — rich.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day:   Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke at Greater Burlington Multicultural Resource Center to mark Monday’s national holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. While King fought to end segregation, he also pressed for better jobs, health care and education — all issues that remain important today, Sanders said on Sunday at the gathering in Burlington, Vt. Sanders’ message echoed his observations in August on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of King’s famous march on Washington. A student at the University of Chicago in 1963, Sanders traveled to Washington, D.C., and was in the massive crowd on The Washington Mall for King’s I Have a Dream speech.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Martin Luther King Day: Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke Sunday at Greater Burlington Multicultural Resource Center in advance of today’s national holiday honoring King. He noted that when King was assassinated, he was fighting to end segregation. He said he also was fighting for education, health care and decent wages — all issues that remain important today. “The work of King is something we must never forget,” Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press.    Veterans Press Congress to Undo Cuts: The $1.1 trillion spending bill Congress passed last week leaves most veterans without relief from cuts in cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees. On Thursday, a group of Republican senators introduced a plan to undo the cuts and extend long-term unemployment benefits. The American Legion endorsed that approach on Friday. Sen. Bernie Sanders also introduced a bill on Thursday to address the cost-of-living cuts as well as several other issues that are important to veterans, The Washington Times reported.  Veterans Group Backs Sanders’ Bill: Sen. Sanders’ legislation is already getting some key support. Sen. Harry Reid is expected to fast-track the legislation under Rule 14, which will allow the bill to skip the committee process, and be taken up after the Senate returns from recess, a spokesperson for Sanders said. The Military Officers Association of America came out with some early support for the bill on Friday afternoon, citing the provision to restore the COLA funding, National Journal reported.  Who Will Congress Cut to Support Troops?: By one estimate, one-third of lawmakers have backed a proposal to reserve the COLA cuts to working-age military retirees. But in a budget constrained environment, the money to reverse the cuts has to come from somewhere, and that's where the unity shatters en. Sanders’ omnibus veterans bill deals with a whole swath of issues from restoring the COLA cuts to expanding scholarship funds. And it looks like it could have momentum. Sen. Harry Reid is expected to file the legislation under Rule 14 -- allowing it to skip the committee process, National Journal reported.

Obama's Pacific Trade Pact Will Be Awful for the Environment:  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that the Obama administration calls a “top priority,” has earned the president relentless criticism for the secrecy of negotiations. Now, drafts of some of the agreement’s chapters, posted by WikiLeaks, are raising new concerns. After the chapter concerning environmental policy and protections went public Wednesday, the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and World Wildlife Fund released a disappointed analysis of its contents. "This draft chapter falls flat on every single one of our issues—oceans, fish, wildlife, and forest protections—and in fact, rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts,” said Michael Brune of the Sierra Club in a statement.

What if Nixon Had the NSA?: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/what-if-nixon-had-the-nsa
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   NSA ‘Out of Control,’ Sanders Says: President Barack Obama's orders to change U.S. surveillance practices avoided major action on the practice of sweeping up billions of phone, email and text messages. “Everybody wants the government to do all it can to make sure this country does not see another terrorist attack. Many of us want to make sure that we protect the American people without undermining the constitutional rights that make us a free people,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Saturday on MSNBC. The Associated Press reported that Sanders remains convinced that the collection of data on every phone call made in the United States violates constitutional privacy protections.   A Chilling Impact: Sen. Sanders said he’s concerned about the impact of what the NSA is doing on American citizens. “And I think all of this stuff has a very significant chilling impact on the willingness of the American people to be thinking about issues, to be writing about issues, to be talking about issues,” Sanders said on KQED-FM in San Francisco, WAMU-FM in Washington D.C., and other NPR affiliates on Weekend Edition.   Left Right Coalition: What distinguishes the surveillance issue from so many that have stymied a polarized Congress is that it does not follow easy patterns. The libertarian right, represented by Sen. Rand. Paul, has joined the liberal left, represented by lawmakers like Sen. Sanders. “Ideology is sort of confusing on this one. When you have Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders on the same side, that makes for a pretty interesting debate,” Sen. Angus King told The New York Times in an article also published on Sunday in the Times Argus and Rutland Herald.   Single Payer Health Care: Sen. Sanders has introduced legislation which would require that each state set up a single-payer insurance system. One upside would be simplicity, said Laura Martin of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada. Some doctors spend as much as a third of their overhead dealing with insurance documents. It would also make life easier for consumers, who would no longer have to pore through reams of paperwork to figure out which insurer covers what, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.

What if Nixon Had the NSA?: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/what-if-nixon-had-the-nsa
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Proposes NSA Reforms: President Obama proposed modest reforms to National Security Agency surveillance programs but maintained that bulk data collection programs are necessary to prevent terrorist attacks. Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer he "would go further" than Obama to protect the privacy rights of the "99.99 percent of Americans who have nothing to do with terrorism." Sanders told CNN’s Jim Sciutto the program is unconstitutional. “When every single phone call made in the United States is kept on file by the government or some other entity, I think you're talking about a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment."   Vermont Delegation on NSA Spying: On WCAX-TV, WFFF-TV and in the Burlington Free Press, Sen. Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch faulted Obama for not going far enough with his reforms. Sen. Patrick Leahy said Obama ordered some “significant changes,” but that more are needed from Congress.  Sanders said he is bringing civil liberties experts to a town meeting Feb. 11. at Vermont’s capital to discuss the issue of domestic surveillance, the Times Argus and Rutland Herald reported.   What If Nixon Had the NSA?: Sanders on Friday raised the possibility of what the bulk data storage means for a future "unscrupulous president" or "rogue operator" at the NSA. "I want people to think, if Nixon had the resources and the technology that now exists. Think of what he would have done," Sanders said on CNN. Sanders said the NSA still “has the potential to give an unscrupulous administration enormous power,” according to Canada’s Calgary Herald.   Senate Plans to Restore Military Pensions: Senate Democrats are planning to push this month for full repeal of a reduction in cost-of-living adjustments for military retirees under age 62, but the issue of how the cost of the change will be offset remains in question. The bill does not currently contain an offset but Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, told Congressional Quarterly, one possibility is cuts in overseas contingency operations funds for the Pentagon and other agencies.

The Week in Review:   President Obama on Friday addressed mounting concern about the National Security Agency tapping into data on millions of Americans’ telephone calls and emails. “I appreciate the president’s willingness to examine this important issue but I think that his remarks did not go far enough,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. On another front, Sanders welcomed Obama’s consideration of using his executive powers to reward federal contracts who pay workers at least a $10.10 an hour minimum wage. A group of senators on Thursday asked broadcast television network executives why their Sunday news and interview programs have largely ignored global warming. And the Senate on Thursday advanced a Sanders bill to expand veterans’ benefits.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-011714
NSA: Out of Control:   Please join Sen. Bernie Sanders for a town meeting on privacy and the increasing violations of constitutional rights that we are seeing from the National Security Agency (NSA). We are delighted that Professor David Cole from Georgetown Law School , and Heidi Boghosian, the Executive Director of the National Lawyers Guild, two of the nation’s preeminent authorities on civil liberties, will be speaking about government surveillance as well as corporate attacks on our privacy rights. We welcome your participation.  The meeting is free and open to the public. RSVP is requested but not required. Call (800) 339-9834 or RSVP via Facebook. If you are unable to attend, but would like to share your views with Bernie, please visit http://sanders.senate.gov/contact.  https://www.facebook.com/events/180944688767570/
What if Nixon Had the NSA?  President Obama said Friday that he would require intelligence agencies to obtain permission from a secret court before tapping into a vast trove of telephone data. The president also directed America's intelligence agencies to stop spying on friendly international leaders. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been a leading critic of the massive surveillance operations by the NSA. Interviewed afterward on CNN, Sanders said there was a need to balance Americans’ constitutional right against unreasonable searches with the need to thoroughly investigate instances when intelligence or law enforcement agencies have a reasonable suspicion of a potential terrorist plot.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Bill Would Repeal Military Pension Cut: Congress gave final approval Thursday to a $1.1 trillion spending bill that eases sharp budget cuts known as the sequester and guarantees that the nation will not endure another government shutdown until at least Oct. 1. The Washington Post online said the bill trims pensions for younger military retirees, but added that an omnibus Veterans Affairs bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders awaiting action in the Senate would repeal the cut. Sanders, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, said during remarks on the Senate floor Thursday that the measure “delivers on the promises that we have made to our service members.” Sanders told Politico the fix is part of a “comprehensive veterans bill” that he believes will be the “most significant veterans bill passed in several decades.”   NSA Surveillance: President Barack Obama's address on government surveillance Friday will be a key step in his re-examination of post-Sept. 11 security practices. In a letter responding to questions raised by Sen. Sanders, National Security Agency head Gen. Keith Alexander said the agency does not "spy" on members of Congress but he did not rule out the collection of metadata from members of Congress, Vermont Public Radio and Truthout reported. "In my view,” Sanders said, “the information collected by the NSA has the potential to give an unscrupulous administration enormous power over elected officials."   Network News Ignores Climate Change: Sen. Bernie Sanders and other members of a new congressional task force on climate change took network television bosses to task over their lack of coverage on global warming last year, Politico, The Huffington Post and Media Matters for America reported. During 2013, influential Sunday news shows only dedicated 27 minutes to the topic -- combined. "If they cover it, then The New York Times is going to cover it," Sanders told National Journal.   Welfare for Wal-Mart: "Do you think the wealthiest family in this country should have large numbers of employees that depend on Medicaid?" Sanders asked a panel of experts testifying before the Joint Economic Committee. He was referring to the Walton family of Wal-mart, which pay so little employees must rely on Medicaid, food stamps and other government assistance, Market Watch, KFSM-TV in Fort Smith, Ark., and other  CBS News affiliates reported.  “That is corporate welfare of the worst kind,” said Robert Reich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a former U.S. Secretary of Labor.

Sen. Sanders' Statement on Funding Bill Passage:   “This is most certainly not the budget that I would have written. At a time when one out of four corporations pays nothing in federal income taxes and income inequality is exploding, this budget fails to ask the richest Americans or most profitable corporations to pay a nickel more in taxes.   “Having said that, this bill makes some significant improvements to the status quo. It adds $1 billion to Head Start to help some 90,000 kids get the early education that they need. This bill will increase funding for home heating assistance, which is very import for senior citizens on fixed incomes and families with young children in Vermont.  “While this is not the bill that I would have written, the alternative – another government shutdown – would have been catastrophic for our country and for the economy.” - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  Sen. Sanders' Statement on Funding Bill Passage: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/statement-on-funding-bill-passage
In 2013 Meet the Press, This Week, Face The Nation and Fox News Sunday spent only 27 minutes talking about climate change. http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/tv-networks-cold-shoulder-for-global-warming
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: Several senators who attended a White House meeting with President Barack Obama on Wednesday brought up the possibility that he could raise the minimum wage by executive order rather than letting the issue fall victim to congressional gridlock. Obama seemed open to it, Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an interview afterward with The Associated Press. “They are taking a hard look at it.” Sens. Sanders and Sherrod Brown “expressed particular delight with the president’s focus on the minimum wage,” according to Politico.   Climate Change: Climate change got more coverage on broadcast news in 2013 than in the previous few years, but the issue still didn't get nearly as much attention as it did in 2009. Media Matters found in a new analysis that ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox Sunday morning programs together devoted only 27 minutes to climate change for the entire year. "Face the Nation" was the first Sunday show in five years to feature scientists discussing climate change. Sens. Sanders and Brian Schatz announced earlier this week that they are launching an effort to pressure television networks to devote more time to covering climate change, The Huffington Post reported.   Global Warming: Sen. Sanders and other senators formed a climate change task force this week aimed at bringing the issue to the foreground in 2014, Bloomberg BNA and the Akron Beacon Journal reported. Members of the group are signing a letter from Sens. Sanders and Schatz to America’s major media outlets asking them to stop ignoring global warming, according to American Thinker and Politix. Sanders wants “the major networks to become a forum for uncontested green propaganda,” Investor’s Business Daily editorialized.   NSA: President Obama will preserve much of the existing Natural Security Agency surveillance program established under President Bush but make modest changes to domestic spying programs which have drawn widespread criticism. Sen. Sanders, one of the National Security Agency's "chief critics," called for far-reaching reforms to ensure Americans' privacy rights are protected. “What we have to do is to make sure that at a time of exploding technology that we figure out ways to make sure that the government does not know about all of your phone calls, your emails and websites," Sanders told CNN on Wednesday in a report broadcast on WGNO-TV in New Orleans and other affiliates nationwide. Sanders criticism of the NSA also was detailed by Fox News and The Week.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/011614

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Unemployment: Negotiations to extend emergency benefits for the long-term jobless deadlocked in the Senate on Tuesday leaving more than 1.4 million people without federal unemployment aid at least until late January, when lawmakers are likely to resume consideration of the legislation. “Not only is it awfully cruel to push these people aside and ignore their needs, it impacts the entire economy," Sen. Bernie Sanders told Alex Wagner on MSNBC.    NSA: The National Security Agency asserted that the government is not spying on lawmakers, but Gen. Keith Alexander said in a letter to Sen. Sanders that the agency can make no guarantee that members of Congress have not had their “telephone metadata” caught up in broad government sweeps, according to the CNN, USA Today online, Time magazine online, the Burlington Free Press, Brattleboro Reformer, The Huffington Post, The Hill, Slate and The Blaze and WJXT-TV in Jacksonville, Fla. “Translation: Yes, we are spying on you,” radio host Bill Press said. Members of Congress “are under the same microscope as everyone else," according to an editorial in the Springfield, Mass., Republican.   Climate Change: Senators on Tuesday unveiled a congressional task force to more aggressively fight climate change, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer have unveiled comprehensive legislation to impose fees on carbon pollution with rebates for consumers, according to KPCC-FM in Los Angeles. One of the first efforts from members of the climate group will be a letter from Sanders and Sen. Brian Schatz asking major television networks to stop ignoring global warming, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported. "Sunday news shows devoted all of eight minutes in 2012 to coverage of climate change issues, which is a decrease from nine minutes the year before,” Sanders told The Hill and National Journal, citing analysis from Media Matters for America.   Obama and Global Warming: Senate Democrats will meet with President Obama Wednesday night to discuss 2014 priorities, and climate change may be on the docket, according to Politico. “There is a growing concern among many of us that the planetary crisis, global warming, has not been emphasized and dealt with as strongly and effectively as it might, so I would not be surprised if that issue came up,” said Sen. Sanders, who will be attending the Wednesday meeting.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/011514

Climate Action Task Force:  Sen. Bernie Sanders and 15 other senators held a Capitol Hill news conference today to announce the formation of a task force on climate change.  The first action by Senate Climate Action Task Force members will be to question why television network Sunday news programs have virtually ignored the issue of climate change. Sanders and Sen. Brian Schatz are taking the lead on the issue.  A study by Media Matters for America reported that throughout 2012 the network programs devoted a total of 8 minutes to the issue of climate change.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Unemployment Insurance: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid delayed a crucial vote on unemployment benefits to give lawmakers more time to negotiate a deal. Lawmakers haggled over how long the emergency benefits, which lapsed on Dec. 28, should last and whether to cut spending elsewhere or raise revenue to pay for the benefits. Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized hypocritical Republicans who extended the same long-term jobless benefits five times without paying for them during the George W. Bush administration, The Huffington Post reported Monday.   NSA Surveillance: President Obama is expected on Friday to announce changes in the surveillance practices of the National Security Agency in the wake of leaked files documenting the agency's far-reaching programs. “The NSA is collecting enormous amounts of information,” Sen. Sanders told the Fox Business News program The Independents. He asked the NSA earlier this month if it spies on members of Congress, according to Daily Tech and The Guardian.   Citizens United: On the fourth anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United, college students across the country will pass student body resolutions against the decision. Sen. Sanders will headline a conference call to kick off the campaign that starts in late January, The Huffington Post reported.  US Emissions Up in 2013: Fossil fuel emissions in the United States rose by 2 percent in 2013, according to All Voices. The uptick marks the first increase in U.S. emissions in three years. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sheldon Whitehouse announced last week plans to create a congressional task force to address climate change. Sen. Sanders is one of more than a dozen colleagues in the group.

Please join Sen. Bernie Sanders on January 26 for a special showing of the new film with Robert Reich. The United States has the highest level of income and wealth inequality of any developed country in the world. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of the financial wealth of the nation, while the bottom 60 percent owns all of 2.3 percent. This is an issue that must be discussed.  This free film will be followed by a town meeting to discuss the issue of income inequality, what it means for the future of our society, and what we can do to make a difference. Sen. Sanders will lead a panel discussion with audience participation.  Free bagels and coffee at 10 a.m. Film begins at 10:30 a.m.  More info here: https://www.facebook.com/events/596751060378247/

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Vermont Guard Awarded for Valor: Six hundred members of the Vermont Army National Guard Sunday formally received the Valorous Unit Award for extraordinary heroism during their service in Afghanistan. Brigadier General Brian Carpenter, commander of the Vermont Army National Guard, commended his soldiers for their bravery in hostile territory. Sen. Bernie Sanders, U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, Gov. Peter Shumlin and Lt. Gov. Phil Scott attended the ceremony, The Associated Press, Bennington Banner and Burlington Free Press reported. “I want to congratulate all of you, not only for your service to our country, but for the very, very impressive and important award that you have received this morning,” Sanders said in the Times Argus and Rutland Herald. “I'm proud to say that you also helped ensure the safety of district and parliamentary elections in Paktia Province -- resulting in over 94,000 people exercising their right to vote,” Sanders said on WCAX-TV.   Guard and Reserve Should be Treated as Veterans: If you serve two or three decades in the National Guard or Reserves and never deploy to someplace like Iraq or Afghanistan, you're not considered a veteran. An editorial in The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer backed a bill by Sens. Sanders and Richard Burr, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, to address veteran status of former Guard and Reserve members who never deployed.   NSA Surveillance: Sen. Sanders has questioned the sweeping surveillance of Americans conducted by National Security Agency. “We can’t continue to refer to ourselves as a quote-unquote free country when the United States is collecting information on virtually every telephone call made in America, getting into people’s emails, focusing on the websites that people are visiting,” Sanders said in a CNN report broadcast Sunday on WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV in Burlington, Vt., WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tenn., KVUE-TV in Austin, Texas, KTBS-TV in Shreveport, La., KQDS-TV in Duluth, Minn., and other stations. “I find myself in bed with strange fellows when it comes to the American government’s unconscionable intrusion everywhere in the everyday lives of everyone of us,” columnist Greg Johnson wrote in the Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel.   Dollarocracy: Robert McChesney, a coauthor with John Nichols of Dollarocracy,” was on C-SPAN’s Book TV on Sunday. He noted that Sen. Sanders wrote the foreword and spoke at a book party in Washington, D.C.  “He said he could state emphatically and without qualification that it is impossible to get any legislation passed in Congress that is opposed by Wall Street or corporate America. Impossible. That's Dollarocracy in a nutshell.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/011314
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Warned on Social Security: Democratic senators want President Obama to abandon his proposal to trim Social Security benefits. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent and co-founder of the Defending Social Security Caucus, told The Hill that lawmakers urged White House chief of staff Denis McDonough to drop from this year’s budget a proposal to change how the consumer price index is calculated in a way that would cut benefits. “To be honest with you, I just can’t imagine what staff people gave him the disastrous advice to propose a chain CPI, which from both a public policy point of view and political point of view is totally absurd.”  Raise the Minimum Wage: The working families of America are struggling. Raising the minimum wage will not solve all our economic problems. It will, however, be an important step forward,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Sunday by the Burlington Free Press.  Reid Open to Amendments on Unemployment: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid opened the door to votes on Republican amendments to avert a stalemate on a new Democratic plan to extend emergency unemployment benefits to November. A spokesman said Reid was in continuing talks with GOP lawmakers and was “absolutely willing for the Senate to consider a reasonable number of relevant amendments from Republicans,” Congressional Quarterly reported.  Solar Slump: Five years after the Obama administration's renewable energy initiative touched off a building boom of large-scale solar power plants across the desert Southwest, the pace of development has slowed to a crawl, with a number of companies going out of business and major projects canceled for lack of financing. Of the 365 federal solar applications since 2009, just 20 plants are on track to be built. Only three large-scale solar facilities have gone online, two in California and one in Nevada. The first auction of public land for solar developers, an event once highly anticipated by federal planners, failed to draw a single bid last fall, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Unemployment Insurance:  http://youtu.be/1HOBw5d8i6Y
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Unemployment: A surprisingly weak December jobs report might have strengthened chances for Senate passage on Monday of emergency jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. The measure’s fate remained in doubt because six Republicans who voted Tuesday to bring an unemployment bill to the Senate floor ended the week angry that they were shut out of negotiations on how to offset the cost of the benefits with spending cuts elsewhere or with new revenue. "What these offsets will be is taking money from Peter to pay Paul," Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz Friday on MSNBC. The senator noted that under President George W. Bush, Republicans voted for five extensions of emergency unemployment without any offsets.  Unemployment: A Bennington Banner editorial praised Sen.Sanders for fighting for a three-month extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. "At a time of growing wealth and income inequality, we cannot turn our backs on 1.3 million people who would be left out in the cold without this help," said Sanders.  IBM Workers: The state and federal departments of labor are seeking input from workers laid off last year at the Essex Junction IBM facility to support their inclusion in a federal training and reemployment program for workers who have lost jobs due to foreign competition. In an illogical decision, the U.S. Department of Labor approved eligibility for the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for IBM's Williston employees but not for Essex Junction workers who performed similar duties.  Sen. Sanders has contacted the U.S. Labor Department, the Colchester Sun reported.   Youth Vote: Benjamin Knapp of Brattleboro won $500 in a Brattleboro Reformer essay contest to promote interest in young people voting. Knapp, 18, said suffrage should be extended to 16-year-olds. “Two years ago, I would have liked to vote … I would have voted for Bernie Sanders, because he struck me as an honest man in a dishonest place.”  Continue reading here:  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/011114
The Week in Review:   The Labor Department announced on Friday that real unemployment last month stood at 13.1 percent. The disappointing economic news came as support shriveled among Senate Republicans for a bill to restore expired benefits for the long-term jobless. Sen. Bernie Sanders is a cosponsor of the bill. Responding to reporters about a letter from Sanders, the National Security Agency on Saturday did not rule out spying on members of Congress. The response fueled mounting concerns among privacy advocates about the dragnet surveillance of telephone, email and Internet records. And Washington on Wednesday marked the 50th anniversary of LBJ’s War on Poverty.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/week-in-review_011014
From 3-4pmET Sen. Sanders will be taking calls on the Thom Hartmann program. Watch live here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Piee86T-3-4&feature=share
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Real Unemployment at 13.1% in December: U.S. employers added a scant 74,000 jobs in December, the fewest in three years. The disappointing gain ends 2013 on a weak note. The Labor Department announced on Friday that the unemployment rate fell from 7 percent in November to 6.7 percent, the lowest level since October 2008, but The Associated Press noted that the drop occurred partly because more Americans stopped looking for jobs. Counting those frustrated job hunters and those forced to settle for part-time work, the real unemployment figure for December was 13.1 percent, unchanged from the month before.   Unemployment Extension: Negotiations over the extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless suffered a major setback in the Senate on Thursday, as competing plans to pay the costs of the extension began to emerge. Democrats offered a roughly $18 billion proposal that would extend the benefits through most of 2014, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid scheduled a showdown vote Monday. Democrats need at least five GOP senators to cross the aisle and support the plan, but they appear to lack the support of several of the key six Republicans who previously supported advancing the bill and have now said they are very likely to vote against the new proposal. The federal law that provides benefits to the long-time unemployed expired on Dec. 28, The Washington Post reported.  Global Warming Task Force: Senate Democrats plan to set up a global warming task force to revive the issue in Congress and help President Obama achieve the goals set out in his climate agenda. Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sheldon Whitehouse told reporters on Thursday that they would launch the task force with more than a dozen members.

Bernie Sanders, she introduced a bill to tax carbon dioxide emissions and use the funds to support renewable energy development, The Daily Caller reported.   Independent America: Forty-two percent of Americans identify themselves as political independents. That’s more than any time in the past 25 years since Gallup began conducting telephone interviews. Only two U.S. senators, Sanders and Angus King, are independents, noted Truthout. Republican identification fell to 25 percent, the lowest in a quarter century.

The War on Poverty:   President Lyndon Johnson declared a War on Poverty in his first State of the Union address delivered 50 years ago this week. There has been progress in the past half century. Seniors have benefited from Medicare and Meals on Wheels. Families with young children have been helped by Head Start. But the stubborn fact remains that today, as Sen. Bernie Sanders put it, “we have more people living in poverty than ever in the history of the United States and our childhood unemployment rate is the highest in the industrial world.”  Watch the video: http://youtu.be/47VqKwTUA5Y  Read more in US News & World Report: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/for-democrats-in-congress-a-return-to-the-war-on-poverty-50-years-later
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Unemployment Insurance: A Senate push to extend federal jobless benefits for three months was put on hold Wednesday as lawmakers sought a way to pay for it. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid postponed a procedural vote on a three-month bill to buy time for negotiations over an offset. “I could live with that,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said of offsets during an interview Wednesday on The Ed Schultz Show. If Republicans want offsets, Sanders said, Congress could come up with the money to pay for the benefits by reining in corporate tax dodgers or cutting wasteful military programs.   Unemployment Insurance: “While there has been some modest improvement in the overall economy, there still are three job applicants for every job opening … As Sen. Sanders has noted, unemployment insurance kept 2.5 million Americans, including 600,000 children, out of poverty in 2012. … Now is not the time to turn our backs on the long-term unemployed,” the Bennington Banner editorialized.   Global Warming: “The scientific community, those responsible for protecting our national security, the American public and corporations increasingly are recognizing that climate change is happening now and that carbon pricing is likely to be part of the solution. It is time for Congress to act,” Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by the San Francisco Chronicle.   The Fed: Change lies ahead as Washington begins 2014 with more gridlock, austerity and partisan posturing, Katrina vanden Heuvel writes in The Washington Post. In the Senate, an emerging caucus of aggressive progressives has begun to challenge the status quo. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley joined Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Advances Jobless Bill: Without a vote to spare, the Senate on Tuesday unexpectedly advanced legislation extending expired unemployment benefits. Sen. Bernie Sanders called Tuesday’s 60-37 Senate vote “an important victory.” He said “it makes both moral and economic sense to help people looking for work,” the Bennington Banner reported.   War on Poverty: In the 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson called in a State of the Union address for a "War on Poverty," Democrats have distanced themselves from discussions about class and inequality. But today Democrats are rolling out a political agenda smaller in scale than Johnson's but equally as ambitious in today's partisan landscape. “There is a greater perception in this country that the middle class continues to decline, that we have more people living in poverty today than we do ever in the history of the United States and our childhood unemployment rate is the highest in the industrial world," says Sen. Sanders told U.S. News & World Report. “Reality has forced many Democrats to seize the issue. When you have more wealth and income inequality today than any time since the 1920s, it is very hard to avoid the issue.”   Veterans’ Benefits: Senior Democrats on Tuesday signaled they could support a deal to repeal $6 billion in military retirement benefit cuts. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hinted Tuesday that the military pension reductions included in last month’s budget deal could get reversed in the omnibus spending bill to fund the government. A bill by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has 18 Democrat co-sponsors as well the backing of Sanders, Military.com reported. “You make a promise to veterans and that promise should be kept,” Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders told The Wall Street Journal.   NSA Spying: Vermont’s independent senator wants to know if the National Security Agency has been ‘‘spying’’ on members of Congress. Sen. Sanders has sent a letter to Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, asking if the agency has spied or is spying on members of Congress or other American elected officials, according to an Associated Press report in the Brattleboro Reformer.

Jobless Aid Advances in Senate:   Legislation to restore benefits for the long-term unemployed overcame a procedural hurdle in the Senate Tuesday. In what Sen. Bernie Sanders called “an important victory,” the legislation that he cosponsored survived a 60-37 test vote on whether to debate a three-month extension of the program.  “At a time of growing wealth and income inequality, we cannot turn our backs on 1.3 million people who would be left out in the cold without this help,” said Sanders. He noted that unemployment insurance kept 2.5 million Americans, including 600,000 children, out of poverty in 2012.  “It makes both moral and economic sense to help people looking for work,” Sanders added. Unless the benefits are restored and job hunters receive disposable income, the economy is expected to lose more than 200,000 jobs this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Each dollar spent on unemployment insurance benefits generates $1.55 in economic recovery.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   War on Poverty: Fifty years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty in his first State of the Union address, President Obama is expected to call for addressing the dramatically widening gap between the rich and everybody else. “The American people are angry; they are hurting; they are sick and tired of Wall Street and the very rich becoming richer while the middle class disappears,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told USA Today. He said income and wealth inequality have "reached obscene proportions."   Sympathy for Snowden: Sen. Bernie Sanders said former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden should be spared a long prison sentence for leaking classified material that showed how the NSA violated Americans’ constitutional rights, CNN, the Burlington Free Press and Vermont Public Radio reported.   NSA Spying: The National Security Agency was evasive with reporters but has not yet formally responded a letter from Sanders asking if it has spied on elected officials, Vermont Public Radio, the Rutland Herald, Mother Jones, Truthdig.org and Roll Call reported. Sanders told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer he wants “a flat, straight-out answer.” On WPTZ-TV, the senator asked, “Are we a quote unquote free society, which … we claim to be if the United States government knows every phone call you've made, knows where you are, has the capability of intercepting your emails and knows the websites that you've visited. Is that what a free society is about?”   The Fed: The Senate confirmed Janet Yellen as the next chief of the Federal Reserve in a historic vote that put a woman in charge of the central bank for the first time but with the weakest show of support in the Fed's 100-year history. With frigid weather nationwide preventing some lawmakers from returning to Washington, the Senate voted 56-26 Monday to approve the former UC Berkeley economist to succeed Ben S. Bernanke on Feb. 1. In all, 45 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted for her confirmation, and 26 GOP lawmakers voted against. Bernanke also was opposed by 12 Democrats and Sanders, the Los Angeles Times noted.

NSA Spying:   Did the National Security Agency spy on elected officials? What should the legal consequences be for Edward Snowden for leaking classified documents that exposed the NSA’s massive surveillance of Americans’ telephone, email and Internet records?   The NSA has not yet directly responded to a letter from Sen. Bernie Sanders asking if members of Congress were part of its dragnet. The agency, however, did not rule it out in a statement to journalists. Sanders discussed the surveillance in interviews on Monday with CNN and WPTZ-TV. “Are we a quote unquote free society, which we tout ourselves to be, we claim to be, if the United States government knows every phone call you've made, knows where you are, has the capability of intercepting your emails and knows the websites that you've visited. Is that what a free society is about?” Sanders said.  Watch the interview here: http://youtu.be/o3zIRHjlEok  Read more here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/nsa-spying
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Income Inequality: Pope Francis, who has captivated the world with a message of economic justice and tolerance, has become a presence in Washington's policy debate. During a Senate Democratic caucus meeting before the holiday recess Sen. Bernie Sanders told his colleagues that when it comes to fighting income inequality “we have a strong ally on our side in this issue – and that is the pope,” The New York Times reported.   NSA Sidesteps Questions on Congressional Spying: The National Security Agency has not denied spying on members of Congress after a senator, Bernie Sanders, demanded answers regarding its surveillance activities, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the London Daily Mail and Democracy Now reported. Sanders bluntly asked if the NSA spies on Congress in a letter that he sent on Friday to the NSA director, WSLS-TV in Roanoke, Va., and WTEV-TV in Jacksonville, Fla., reported.   Aid for Unemployed: Democrats continued on Sunday to argue for restoring long-term unemployment insurance for more than a million Americans who are out of work, days after the benefits lapsed, as lawmakers prepared to return from their recess, The New York Times reported.   Janet Yellen: The U.S. Senate is expected to confirm Janet Yellen Monday to serve as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, after Ben Bernanke's second term ends in January. She will be the first woman to head the Federal Reserve in its 100-year history, CNN Money reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/010614

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   NSA Spying: In a statement that did not deny collecting communications from members of Congress, the National Security Agency on Saturday responded to journalists’ questions about a letter to the NSA from Sen. Bernie Sanders asking if it has spied on elected officials, the Burlington Free Press, The Washington Post, The Guardian, CNN, Business Insider, The Huffington Post, Al Jazeera and The Verge reported.  NSA Spying: CNN reported that the senator “got a response from the NSA, sort of.”  The NSA said members of Congress “well, they're just like everyone else.” Fox News said Sanders “has tough questions” for the NSA director, Gen. Keith Alexander.  USPS Under Attack: Rep. Darrell Issa is pushing to diminish the United States Postal Service by ending Saturday mail delivery. The Nation’s John Nichols argues that instead of crippling the USPS Congress should support measures to strengthen the Postal Service such as those by Sen. Sanders and Reps. Peter DeFazio and Mark Pocan.  War on Poverty: To many Americans, the war on poverty declared 50 years ago by President Lyndon B. Johnson has largely failed. The poverty rate has fallen only to 15 percent from 19 percent in two generations, and 46 million Americans live in households where the government considers their income scarcely adequate. But looked at a different way, the federal government has succeeded in preventing the poverty rate from climbing far higher, The New York Times reported.

Must Read: NSA statement does not deny 'spying' on members of Congress - Spencer Ackerman and Martin Pengelly, The Guardian:   The National Security Agency on Saturday released a statement in answer to questions from a senator about whether it “has spied, or is … currently spying, on members of Congress or other American elected officials”, in which it did not deny collecting communications from legislators of the US Congress to whom it says it is accountable.  In a letter dated 3 January, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont defined “spying” as “gathering metadata on calls made from official or personal phones, content from websites visited or emails sent, or collecting any other data from a third party not made available to the general public in the regular course of business”.  The agency has been at the centre of political controversy since a former contractor, Edward Snowden, released thousands of documents on its activities to media outlets including the Guardian.  In its statement, which comes as the NSA gears up for a make-or-break legislative battle over the scope of its surveillance powers, the agency pointed to “privacy protections” which it says it keeps on all Americans' phone records.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Does the NSA Spy on Congress?: A U.S. senator has bluntly asked the National Security Agency if it spies on Congress. Sen. Bernie Sanders raised the question in a letter that he sent on Friday to the NSA director, The Guardian, the Burlington Free Press, The Washington Times, UPI, Congressional Quarterly, The Hill, Politico, Roll Call, The Huffington Post, Washington Examiner, Raw Story, Talking Points Memo, Pando Daily, TechDirt, Buzz Feed, Daily Oklahoman and FoxNews.com reported.  Sanders Cites Court Ruling: Sen. Sanders’ letter to Gen. Keith Alexander cited a ruling last month by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon that the NSA's bulk collection of telephone metadata was probably unconstitutional. Later Friday, the Justice Department filed a one-page notice of appeal asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn Leon's ruling. Sanders has introduced legislation that would limit the records the NSA and FBI may search and  would require officials to establish a reasonable suspicion in order to secure court approval to monitor business records related to a terrorism suspect, the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune reported. LINK  Secret Court Oks More Metadata: For the 36th time on Friday, a  secret federal court approved the National Security Agency's bulk collection of telephone metadata allowing the agency to continue gathering phone records even as dueling court cases moved forward this week over the controversial program. Meanwhile, pressure on the NSA is mounting in Congress. The NSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment  on Sen. Sanders’ letter asking if intelligence analysts had ever scrutinized U.S. governmental telephone metadata or electronic communications. The Washington Post reported online.

The Week in Review  As the new year began, Sen. Bernie Sanders laid out a progressive agenda for 2014. In a column and a webvideo, the senator outlined ways to deal with a host of key issues ranging from income inequality to global warming. The Senate is set to vote this coming Monday on extending benefits for the long-term unemployed. Sanders on Tuesday said raising the minimum wage also should be a top priority. And on Friday, he questioned the head of the National Security Agency about the scope of its domestic surveillance operations.

Is the NSA Spying on Congress?  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday asked the National Security Agency director whether the agency has monitored the phone calls, emails and Internet traffic of members of Congress and other elected officials. “Has the NSA spied, or is the NSA currently spying, on members of Congress or other American elected officials?” Sanders asked in a letter to Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA director. “ ‘Spying’ would include gathering metadata on calls made from official or personal phones, content from websites visited or emails sent, or collecting any other data from a third party not made available to the general public in the regular course of business?”  Sanders said he was “deeply concerned” by revelations that American intelligence agencies harvested records of phone calls, emails and web activity by millions of innocent Americans without any reason to even suspect involvement in illegal activities. He also cited reports that the United States eavesdropped on the leaders of Germany, Mexico, Brazil and other allies.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Minimum Wage: Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke out on Tuesday in favor of raising the federal minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour. Michael Harrington, Bennington's economic and community development director, worried about the impact on employers. Harrington said many local small businesses are "doing the best they can," and a wage increase of several dollars an hour could very well put them out of business, the Bennington Banner reported.  Minimum Wage: According to the Pew Research Center, 71 percent favor raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $9.00 an hour, as President Obama has proposed, but Republicans say raising the minimum wage would kill jobs. Sen. Sanders disagrees, according to examiner.com. "I say they’re just factually wrong,” Sanders said. “In my state of Vermont, our minimum wage is $8.60 compared to the national minimum wage of $7.25. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in America. You have states where there is virtually no minimum wage at all, and their unemployment rate is much higher. The facts just don’t bear it out.”   Veterans' Benefits: Congress has traditionally rounded down veterans' disability compensation adjustments to the nearest dollar. The rounding did not happen in 2013, thanks to Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate veterans committee. Sanders had hoped to achieve much more, according to Stars and Stripes and military.com. On Dec. 18, he asked the full Senate to approve a package of new benefits for veterans and surviving spouses. Sen. Tom Coburn put a hold on the bill. "I certainly wouldn't use this year as a gauge for how effective [Sanders] is as chairman," said Joseph Violante, legislative director of Disabled American Veterans. "He's been a strong advocate…and we will probably see some legislation this coming session."   NSA Wants Computer to Crack Encryption: The National Security Agency is racing to build a computer that could break nearly every kind of encryption used to protect banking, medical, business and government records around the world. According to documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the effort to build a machine exponentially faster than classical computers is part of a $79.7 million research program titled “Penetrating Hard Targets.” Much of the work is hosted under classified contracts at a laboratory in College Park, Md., The Washington Post reported.

Today's News from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: Sen. Bernie Sanders wants Congress to increase the federal minimum wages to $10.10 per hour. The independent senator made the call while highlighting that Vermont and a number of other states raised their minimum wages effective on New Year’s Day, according to an Associated Press report in the Bennington Banner, Burlington Free Press, Brattleboro Reformer, Caledonian-Record and Valley News. Sanders said raising the federal minimum wage would give Americans $35-billion more to spend in their take-home pay and that would, in turn, create 85,000 more jobs, WPTZ-TV and New England Cable News reported.   Citizens United: Sixteen states have formally petitioned Congress to enact a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling which frees corporations to spend as much as they choose to influence elections. “Roughly 100 House members have sponsored or cosponsored amendment proposals, as have key senators such as Sanders and Sherrod Brown. Getting more states to formally demand action will cause more congressional buy-in for this necessary reform,” John Nichols blogged for The Nation.   A Progressive Agenda: As growing numbers of voters and even some top Republicans in Congress express unhappiness with the Tea Party after a government shutdown, progressive liberals like Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are trying to fill a space in the political debate by pushing issues such as income inequality and increasing minimum wage. Sanders posted his priorities for 2014 on Monday in a blog on Huffington Post, The Washington Times reported.   Resurgent Left: “The re-emergence of a Democratic left will be one of the major stories of 2014 … [T]he new militancy on the Democratic left is a consequence of a slowly building backlash against the skewed nature of our politics. Take the most recent flash point. Discussions about entitlements have revolved almost exclusively around the question of how much to cut them. By contrast, progressives such as Sens. Warren, Sanders, and Sherrod Brown, say we must begin dealing with a coming retirement crisis fostered by the steady disappearance of traditional private pensions,” columnist E.J. Dionne Jr., wrote in Thursday’s Washington Post, Anchorage Daily News, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Bristol (Conn.) Press.

New Year's Day:   The first day of 2014 means a pay raise in for workers in Vermont and 12 other states making the minimum wage set by state laws. Sen. Bernie Sanders thinks workers across the United States deserve a living wage and cosponsored legislation to boost the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. “States and communities are not waiting for Congress to raise the minimum wage.  They are doing the right thing because the simple truth is that working people cannot survive on the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, or $8 an hour or $9 an hour. If people work 40 hours a week, they deserve not to live in dire poverty,” Sanders said.  Wage increases at the state and local level are occurring at a time of growing income inequality.  In the last several years, 95 percent of all new income went to the top 1 percent. “We need to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour,” said Sanders. “That’s why I cosponsored legislation which will soon be on the Senate floor.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/new-years-day  Watch Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Resurgent Progressives: “The re-emergence of a Democratic left will be one of the major stories of 2014. For a long time, the American conversation has been terribly distorted by the existence of an active, uncompromising political right … Discussions about entitlements have revolved almost exclusively around the question of how much to cut them. By contrast, progressives such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown say we must begin dealing with a coming retirement crisis fostered by the steady disappearance of traditional private pensions,” Washington Post Writers Group columnist E.J. Dionne Jr. wrote.  White House ’16: “Inside the liberal activist world, there’s already a Hillary-centric debate going on: Should we just make our peace with her because she seems inevitable and we want a woman president and so on, or should we defy her as just another Rubinite who’ll sell us out and declare our allegiance to [Elizabeth] Warren or Bernie Sanders?”  Michael Tomasky wrote in The Daily Beast.  2014: Seize the Moment: Congress has just ended one of the worst and least productive sessions in the history of our country. Clearly, if we are going to save the middle class and protect our planet, we need to change the political dynamics of the nation. We can no longer allow the billionaires and their think tanks or the corporate media to set the agenda,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published by the Times Argus.

2014: Seize the Moment:   The Congress has just ended one of the worst and least productive sessions in the history of our country. At a time when the problems facing us are monumental, Congress is dysfunctional and more and more people (especially the young) are, understandably, giving up on the political process. The people are hurting. They look to Washington for help. Nothing is happening.  In my view, the main cause of congressional dysfunction is an extreme right-wing Republican party whose main goal is to protect the wealthy and powerful. There is no tax break for the rich or large corporations that they don't like. There is no program which protects working families -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, affordable housing, etc. -- that they don't want to cut.  But the Democrats (with whom I caucus as an Independent) are most certainly not without fault. In the Senate, they have tolerated Republican obstructionism for much too long and allowed major legislation to fail for lack of 60 votes. They have failed to bring forth a strong and consistent agenda which addresses the economic crises facing the vast majority of our struggling population, and have not rallied the people in support of that agenda.  As we survey our country at the end of 2013, I don't have to tell you about the crises we face. Many of you are experiencing them every day.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: The federal minimum wage should be raised from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour, Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday that. “Most people understand that is a starvation wage. Individuals can't live on it, families can't live on it,” Sanders said. He is a cosponsor of a bill that would raise the wage.   Unemployment: If Congress fails to extend long-term unemployment benefits that expired on Saturday for 1.3 million Americans, another 5 million people looking for work will lose benefits this year. “You are cutting off your nose to spite your face by denying people who need the help the help they should be getting,” Sen. Sanders said on WCAX-TV on Monday. He explained why on The Ed Schultz Show. “What the economists tell us is that if we shut off extended unemployment benefits, we are going to lose about 200,000 jobs, because these folks will not be spending money and the GDP for next year will go down by about two-tenths of 1 percent.”  NSA Spying: Vermont lawmakers support legislation to rein in massive National Security Agency surveillance programs, Vermont Public Radio reported. “If they have probable cause that somebody is involved in terrorism, go after them and do all the investigating you have to do tap all the phones you have to tap,” said Sen. Sanders. “But that is a very different proposition than saying we are going to be collecting data on virtually every single American 99.9 percent of whom have nothing to do with terrorism.”   Seize the Moment: “If we are going to save the middle class and protect our planet, we need to change the political dynamics of the nation. We can no longer allow the billionaires and their think tanks or the corporate media to set the agenda. We need to educate, organize and mobilize the working families of our country to stand up for their rights,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column for Daily Kos, Green Mountain Daily, OpEd News, Truth Dig and Michael Moore. There also was a commentary posted by Daily Kos.

Minimum Wage: With polls showing widespread support for an increase in the $7.25-per-hour federal minimum wage among both Republican and Democratic voters, top Democrats see a tool with which to enlarge the electorate in a nonpresidential election, when turnout among minorities and youths typically drops off. The effort to take advantage of growing populism among voters in both parties is being coordinated by officials from the White House, labor unions and liberal advocacy groups, according to The New York Times.   NSA Spying: A German magazine lifted the lid on the operations of the National Security Agency’s hacking unit Sunday, reporting that American spies intercept computer deliveries, exploit hardware vulnerabilities, and even hijack Microsoft’s internal reporting system to spy on their targets. Der Spiegel’s revelations relate to a division of the NSA known as Tailored Access Operations, or TAO, which is painted as an elite team of hackers specializing in stealing data from the toughest of targets. The Washington Post reported.   Unemployment: More than 1.3 million Americans, including some 600 Vermonters, lost long-term unemployment benefits when a federal law expired on Saturday. “It is not only immoral to cut off help for workers struggling to find jobs, it is also bad economics,” Sen. Sanders tweeted over the weekend, according to a Monday morning report on WFFF-TV.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/123013

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Unemployed Cutoff: Long-term unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans expired Saturday after Congress failed to pass an extension. “It is not only immoral to cut off help for workers struggling to find jobs, it is also bad economics,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said  in a tweet noted by CNN. He pointed out that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects a 0.2 percent drop in the nation’s gross domestic product—and the loss of 200,000 additional jobs—unless the benefits are extended, John Nichols blogged for The Nation.    NSA Spying: Sen. Sanders wrote that "the NSA today is out of control and we need strong legislation to rein them in. In a free society, the government does not collect data on tens of millions of people, 99.999 percent of whom have nothing to do with terrorism. We must be vigilant in protecting the American people from terrorism, but we can do that without taking away the constitutional and privacy rights which make us a free nation," Max Obuszewski noted in a letter to the editor of The Baltimore Sun.   Populists: “What we're seeing more broadly though is a rise in populism in both the Republican and the Democratic parties and there's a divide within each party. On the Democratic side you see Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. On the Republican side, there's very much an open space for someone to emerge and espouse that kind of conservative populism,” a commentator told Alex Witt in an interview Saturday on MSNBC.

Unless Congress acts when it reconvenes in January, the same fate awaits an additional 1.9 million people during the first half of 2014. Sen. Bernie Sanders said cutting benefits not only hurts the unemployed, it hurts the overall economy, according to MSNBC, the Burlington Free Press, Times Argus, Rutland Herald, Bennington Banner, The Progressive and The Washington Times.   NSA Spying on Americans: A federal judge on Friday ruled that a National Security Agency program that collects enormous troves of phone records is legal. Earlier this month another federal judge and a presidential panel reached the opposite conclusion. Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy continue to believe the NSA is making mistakes, WPTZ-TV reported. “I think that the idea that the NSA is keeping files on every phone call made in the United States of America, intercepting emails, going into the websites is way, way, way over the top,” Sanders said in a report broadcast Friday and Saturday.

The Week in Review:  Saturday’s expiration date for unemployment benefits directly impacts 1.3 million Americans still struggling as a result of the recession. There will be ramifications for the rest of us as the cutoff weighs down the overall economy. Sen. Bernie Sanders is the cosponsor of a bill to restore the benefits. In Vermont, state officials sought federal disaster assistance to help cope with an ice storm that glazed much of New England during the holiday week. Keeping with an annual tradition, Vermont’s congressional delegation invited young Vermonters nominated to the nation’s military service academies to a Saturday reception held in their honor at the Statehouse in Montpelier.

Sen. Sanders talks with MSNBC's Alex Witt about the need to extend unemployment insurance: http://youtu.be/pEGMiUkG6h4
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Single-Payer Health Care: Amid the Affordable Care Act's turbulent implementation, The Atlantic magazine examined Vermont’s Green Mountain Healthcare, which aims to guarantee universal insurance coverage and improve benefits. Sen. Sanders said the new system will be a relief to businesses, which will see an increased tax burden but won’t have to spend vast sums on employees’ insurance and administer the benefits. He hopes the plan will become an example for other states. “Americans want to see a model that works,” the senator said. “If Vermont can be that model it will have a profound impact on discourse in this country.”   IBM Workers: The Vermont Department of Labor has gotten federal help for some, but not all, of the workers let go last summer by IBM in Essex Junction and Williston. “I appreciate that the U.S. Department of Labor ruled on behalf of IBM’s Williston workers. I am dismayed, however, they have not yet ruled in favor of those Vermonters who worked on the Essex Junction cam pus,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. Sanders contacted the Department of Labor to express his support for all of IBM employees who lost their jobs, The Associated Press, Burlington Free Press and Vermont Public Radio reported.  Unemployment: Congressional Democrats on Thursday denounced the imminent expiration of emergency unemployment insurance, with one terming it a “moral outrage,” and reiterated that they will seek the program’s extension in the new year, Congressional Quarterly reported. Without an extension, 1.3 million people will immediately lose those benefits, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer noted.   Obama Signs Budget Bill: President Obama has signed a bill that provides a broad outline for the federal budget through 2015 and eases some of sequestration’s cuts, the White House said Thursday. The Bipartisan Budget Act restores a total of $63 billion in discretionary funding to the Defense Department and some domestic agencies in 2014 and 2015, but also includes $85 billion in deficit reduction. When Congress returns in January, lawmakers will still need to approve a bill that authorizes spending through the end of the fiscal year, or for a shorter period of time, as has been the case in recent years, Politico reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Community Health Centers Community health centers are expanding throughout the country as a result of an $11 billion provision added by Sen. Bernie Sanders to the Affordable Care Act that passed in 2010, The Nation’s John Nichols told Ed Schultz in a radio interview broadcast on Tuesday. “Bernie Sanders, as part of the negotiations on the Affordable Care Act, included significant funding for public health centers across the country,” Nichols said.  Social Security: Rep. Peter DeFazio told The Thom Hartmann Program on Tuesday that he and Sen. Bernie Sanders are working to raise the cap on income subject to the payroll tax to strengthen the retirement program for generations to come.

Senate Democrats have vowed to make the issue a top priority when they return to Washington in January. Lawmakers have extended the program 11 times, never allowing it to lapse — until now, The Washington Post reported.   NSA Reform: A measure that President Obama is considering as a way to curb the National Security Agency’s mass storage of phone data is facing resistance from the intelligence community, privacy advocates, the phone industry and some lawmakers. Obama last week suggested that he was open to the idea of requiring phone companies to store the records and allowing the government to search them under strict guidelines. Currently, the agency stores those records itself, The Washington Post reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/122613
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  NSA ‘Out of Control’: Sen. Bernie Sanders weighed in on the debate over Edward Snowden and privacy abuses by what he called an “out of control” National Security Agency. At a news conference Monday, Sanders criticized that the NSA’s method of collecting mass quantities of personal information about Americans. Sanders also said that the man who leaked NSA secret documents on surveillance operations provided the country with a great deal of information, but he said a decision to grant Edward Snowden amnesty should be left up to the legal system, WCAX-TV reported.   Early Childhood Learning: Gov. Peter Shumlin and members of the state's congressional delegation say a $37 million federal education grant is designed to ensure that all Vermont children will be ready to succeed when they get to school. Shumlin, Sen. Sanders, Rep. Peter Welch and a representative of Sen. Patrick Leahy said Monday the goal of the Early Learning Race to the Top Grant is to expand awareness of the importance of early education, increase participation in an early learning program and focus services on high-needs children, The Associated Press, WPTZ-TV, WCAX-TV and vtdigger.org reported.  Raise the Minimum Wage: “Not only would increasing the minimum wage boost the economy and narrow the gap between the rich and the poor, it would also reduce the deficit. Today, tens of millions of Americans working in Wal-Mart, McDonald’s, Burger King and other multi-national corporations are being paid wages so low that they need food stamps, Medicaid, public housing, and other forms of government assistance just to survive. In fact, American taxpayers are subsidizing the poverty-level wages of some of the largest and most profitable corporations in America,” Sen. Sanders wrote in an op-ed published by the Times Argus, Newport Daily Express and St. Albans Messenger.   USPS: Postal workers are giving it their all this holiday season … [but] are still under assault [by] … House members who want nothing more than to diminish the United States Postal Service to such an extent that it can be bartered off to the highest bidder ... The service could thrive if more elected officials followed the lead of” Sen. Sanders, Reps. Peter DeFazio and Mark Pocan “who have proposed and fought for smart reforms,” John Nichols wrote in The (Madison Wis.,) Capital Times.

Early Childhood Education:   Sen. Bernie Sanders joined Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin at a Statehouse news conference in Montpelier, Vt., on Monday to highlight a $36.9 million federal Race to the Top grant. Rep. Peter Welch also participated in the news conference on the early education grant.  “Psychologists tell us that, in terms of human development, the most important years are birth through four years of age,” said Sanders, a member of the Senate education committee. “Yet, in terms of early childhood education, our nation does a very inadequate job in making quality pre-kindergarten education available to working families. This major federal grant will significantly improve early childhood education in our state and better prepare our kids for school and the challenges and opportunities of life.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/early-childhood-education
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Iran Sanctions: The fate of Iran sanctions legislation will depend heavily on whether Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decides to bring the bill to a floor vote in January. In the event there is a vote, the question becomes how many Democrats will stand by the White House and oppose additional sanctions at this time. Most if not all Republicans would likely vote for new sanctions. A Congressional Quarterly tally found 31 Democratic caucus members publicly uncommitted. “It’s worth some study,” Sen. Bernard Sanders said.   White House ’16: A national group of left-leaning progressives says its members strongly support a bid for the White House recently floated by Sen. Sanders. In a poll being released this morning, a group called RootsAction.org found that 81 percent of 19,131 of its members responding to an on-li ne poll said “yes” when asked the question, “Do you want Senator Bernie Sanders to run for president in 2016?” Another 10 percent of the respondents said they weren’t sure and 9 percent answered “No,” according to the Burlington Free Press.  U.S. Uniforms Made Overseas: One of the world’s biggest clothing buyers, the United States government spends more than $1.5 billion a year at factories overseas, acquiring everything from the royal blue shirts worn by airport security workers to the olive button-downs required for forest rangers and the camouflage pants sold to troops on military bases. Labor Department officials say that federal agencies have a “zero tolerance” policy on using overseas plants that break local laws, but American government suppliers in countries including Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Mexico, Pakistan and Vietnam show a pattern of legal violations and harsh working conditions, according to The New York Times.   Jobs in Vermont: Vermont’s employers created 2,200 jobs in November, bringing the state to a 12-month high in employment, according to a new report by the state Department of Labor. With jobless numbers down from 4.5 percent to 4.4 percent in November and employment on the rise, Matthew Barewicz, the state’s chief of economic and labor market information, said Vermont is on the road to recovery from the 2008 nationwide recession, Vermont Public Radio reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Bernie’s Budget: Sen. Bernie Sanders was singled out in The Nation’s Progressive Honor Role for 2013 for his work on the budget. “When the Vermont senator joined the select Senate and House budget committee after the GOP-led government shutdown, he did so as a steadfast opponent of cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. But Sanders went further, producing a progressive budget blueprint that seeks to shift the debate from austerity and toward fairness,” John Nichols wrote.  A Win for Vermont Kids: Vermont won a $37 million federal grant to invest in early childhood education, Sen. Sanders and Gov. Peter Shumlin announced Thursday. The four-year Race to the Top grant is the largest single investment of its kind in state history, Shumlin said, according to Seven Days. LINK  Economic Model: “I was struck by the power of a message from Sen. Sanders in a recently released letter to his supporters: ‘The greatest crisis facing our country today is the obscene level of wealth and income inequality we now see.’  The good senator doesn’t mince his words … But to the senator’s list of moral, economic and political issues, I would add the environment and our communities — because they are also at risk under the current economic model,” Elizabeth Courtney wrote in a column for the Times Argus and Rutland Herald.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Long-term Jobless Benefits: to End Hundreds of Vermonters and more than 1.3 million Americans will lose long-term jobless benefits on Dec. 28 as Congress recessed for the year without taking action to extend them, the Burlington Free Press reported. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy both expressed disappointment that the budget deal they both supported did not include language to extend long-term unemployment benefits for an additional three months.  NSA Reforms: President Barack Obama’s independent review group this week suggested a plethora of reforms to the nation’s far-reaching intelligence gathering programs. Sen. Sanders said of the “out-of-control” National Security Agency Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program, “We need some very strong legislation to rein them in.”  Voting Rights: Republicans worried about losing elections are erecting legal roadblocks that prevent people from voting in many states. “Our Republican friends are too cowardly, in many respects, to have fair elections and the only way they’re going to win is if they deny lower income people, people of color, older people from the right to vote by making it harder and harder,” Sen. Sanders said Friday on MSNBC.  Defense Bill: The Senate passed a comprehensive defense bill in an 84-15 vote on Thursday, CBS News reported online. “The time is long overdue for us to take a hard look at the waste, at the cost overruns, at the financial mismanagement that have plagued the Department of Defense for decades,” Sen. Bernie said on WCAX-TV.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/122113
The Week in Review:   The National Security Agency's bulk collection of millions of innocent Americans' telephone records came under fire from a scalding decision by a federal judge, from the president's own advisory committee and from critics in Congress, including Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Senate late on Thursday passed and sent to the White House a Pentagon spending bill that Sanders opposed. Also awaiting President Obama’s signature is a two-year budget pact that had Sanders’ lukewarm support. Congress left Washington for the holidays without extending unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans out of work for six months or more.

NA
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Bloated Pentagon Bill Passes Senate: The vote was 84–15. Those voting against the bill included Sen. Bernie Sanders, 12 Republicans and two Democrats, The Associated Press reported. “I support a strong defense,” Sanders said “At a time, however, when the country has a $17.2 trillion national debt and is struggling with huge unmet needs, it is unacceptable that the Defense Department continues to waste massive amounts of money,” he added on WPTZ-TV and WNEW-FM in Washington, D.C.  Sanders noted that the U.S. spends as much on defense as the rest of the world combined, The Wall Street Journal, National Public Radio and KFWB-AM in Los Angeles reported.  Minimum Wage: Senate Democrats are stepping up pressure on Republicans to raise the minimum wage, promising a vote on legislation as soon as Congress comes back from its holiday break. Sen. Sanders supports the increase, which would affect 30 million Americans, WAMC-FM reported. "We have got to raise the minimum wage, which today is a starvation wage of $7.25, to at least $10.10 an hour," Sanders told MSNBC on Thursday.   Corporate Loopholes: Corporate loopholes cost the country some $100 billion per year, Sen. Sanders told MSNBC on Thursday. Sanders said many corporations are “stashing their money” in places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes in the United States. Sen. Sanders has proposed legislation to close these loopholes.  Pre-K Schools: Vermont won a $37 million federal grant to invest in early childhood education, the Burlington Free Press reported. A member of the Senate education committee, Sen. Sanders urged Education Secretary Arne Duncan to help Vermont and other rural states. According to Sanders, the four-year grant will allow the state to establish a system to serve every child in Vermont, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported.

Sen. Sanders talks about the bloated Department of Defense budget: http://youtu.be/2KeReGOhUWk
Pentagon Bloat:   Working late into the night on Thursday, the Senate was to vote near midnight on a Department of Defense bill to authorize $625 billion for the military. Bernie opposed the legislation. “At a time when the United States has a $17.2 trillion national debt and when we spend almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined, the time is long overdue for us to take a hard look at the waste, cost overruns and financial mismanagement that have plagued the huge Defense Department for years.  “The situation is so absurd that the Pentagon is unable to even account for how it spends its money. Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office cited its inability to audit the Pentagon. They wrote that they were unable to do a comprehensive financial analysis due to ‘serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense that made its financial statements un-auditable.’  “I support a strong defense system for our country and a robust National Guard and Reserve that can meet our domestic and foreign challenges. At a time, however, when the country has a $17.2 trillion national debt and is struggling with huge unmet needs, it is unacceptable that the Defense Department continues to waste massive amounts of money,” Sanders said.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/pentagon-bloat

Pre-K in Vermont:   Vermont today won a $37 million federal grant to develop a statewide, pre-kindergarten program at public schools. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate education committee, worked closely with federal officials and Gov. Peter Shumlin’s administration to secure the grant for early childhood education.  Sanders said, “Psychologists tell us that, in terms of human development, the most important years are birth through four years of age. Yet, in terms of early childhood education, our nation does a very inadequate job in making quality pre-kindergarten education available to working families. This major federal grant will significantly improve early childhood education in our state and better prepare our kids for school and the challenges and opportunities of life.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate Passes Budget: The Senate on Wednesday approved a budget deal to fund the government until 2015 and reduce the impact of deep sequestration cuts. Sen. Bernie Sanders voted for the agreement, which he called "the lesser of two evils" on MSNBC and Vermont Public Radio. “It beats seeing shutdowns in the government. It beats seeing more devastating cuts to Head Start, Meals on Wheels, education, heating assistance and many programs that benefit working families,” Sanders said. But on KFWB-AM in Los Angeles and other NBC Radio News affiliates, Sanders noted that “one out of four corporations pay zero in federal taxes. We didn’t get another nickel from them.”    Unemployment Benefits Set to Expire: Without an extension, 1.3 million Americans stand to lose their long-term unemployment benefits. Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Ed Schultz Show he expects "legislation coming up very, very early next year" to extend the emergency unemployment aid. "When the American people speak loudly and clearly that you cannot throw 1.3 million families out into the streets, that you really just cannot cut off those benefits, we are going to win this fight," Sanders said.   Minimum Wage: “There are at least four major economic issues facing this country: high unemployment; low wages; the growth in poverty; and the obscene level of income and wealth inequality that keeps getting worse. One important way to address all of these problems is for Congress to substantially increase the minimum wage,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published by the Brattleboro Reformer.   Veterans' Bill Blocked: Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an attempt to pass a comprehensive veterans' benefits bill that would expand medical and educational benefits for veterans, Congressional Quarterly reported. “I’m disappointed that there is objection to a bill that came out of the committee without objection, that was done in a bipartisan manner, that is paid for and that has the support of virtually every veterans’ committee,” said Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/121913
Budget Bill Sent to White House:  The Senate on Wednesday evening passed and sent to President Obama a budget that averts another government shutdown, eases sharp spending cuts known as sequestration and spares Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid from proposed cuts in benefits. In what he called a difficult decision, Sen. Bernie Sanders voted with the 64 - 36 majority to pass the budget. He voiced disappointment that it does nothing to create jobs and continues tax breaks for profitable corporations. His decision to vote for the bill boiled down to a choice between the “lesser of two evils,” Sanders said in an interview minutes after the vote with MSNBC’s Ed Schultz.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Spying on Americans: In the wake of a federal court ruling against domestic spying by the National Security Agency, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Congress must narrow the scope of a law used to justify the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records. “I voted against the Patriot Act. We've introduced legislation to curb what the NSA is doing,” Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts. Lawmakers supporting the vast domestic surveillance databases argue that collecting phone records and emails makes the country safer. "Yeah it does," Sanders said in a report broadcast by NBC News affiliates nationwide. "But it doesn't make us a free country."   NSA is 'Out of Control': The National Security Agency is "out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner," Sen. Sanders said, according to The Nation, ABC News Radio, Vermont Public Radio and Common Dreams. "I will be working as hard as I can to pass the strongest legislation possible to end the abuses by the NSA and other intelligence agencies,” Sanders said. A Brattleboro Reformer editorial said, “Sanders is right to pursue this matter further, for one federal judge’s ruling certainly won’t bring an end to the NSA spying controversy.”  Tech Giants Air Privacy Worries at White House: President Obama met Tuesday with the nation's leading technology executives who want changes of surveillance programs in the name of civil liberties, a concern that CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta said is spreading in Congress. “It’s not just the executives of these tech companies, not just a federal judge who says that these collections of phone records may be unconstitutional. You have lawmakers up on Capitol Hill, the entire spectrum from Bernie Sanders all the way over to Rand Paul, saying that something has to be done.”   Senate Poised to Pass Budget: A bipartisan agreement to ease sharp spending cuts known as sequestration easily cleared its last major hurdle Tuesday as 67 senators voted to advance the measure. “This is a very difficult vote. It’s very much the lesser of two evils,” Sen. Sanders, according to Real Clear Politics.  Sanders was an unenthusiastic supporter, according to CNN. "This budget does not even begin to address some of the very serious problems facing our country in terms of creating the millions of jobs we need, in terms of doing away with these outrageous corporate loopholes right now which are costing us about $100 billion a year," Sanders told  Nicole Sandler on The Randi Rhodes Show.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Judge Slams NSA Spying on Americans: National Security Agency programs involving the bulk collection of Americans' telephone records “almost certainly” violate the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches, according to a Monday ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the NSA "out of control," saying it was "operating in an unconstitutional manner," The Associated Press, Burlington Free Press, Bennington Banner, WCAX-TV, WPTZ-TV and The Washington Times reported.   An Invasion of Privacy: “Not voting for the USA Patriot Act was one of the better votes that I've ever cast. In my view, the NSA is out of control and is very clearly acting in an unconstitutional manner. Terrorism remains a serious issue and we must do all that we can to protect the American people, but we don't have to do it through a massive invasion of privacy rights or undermining the constitutional rights of the American people,” Sen. Sanders told reddit.   Senate to Vote on Budget: A bipartisan budget agreement now appears to have sufficient support to survive a key procedural test vote in the Senate today, but it could be a close vote with Sen. Sanders still undecided because the bill does not extend unemployment insurance, The Washington Post online, National Journal and The Hill reported. Sanders told Bloomberg/Businessweeek it’s a Hobson’s choice. “Whether you vote yes or whether you vote no, it’s a bad vote,” Sanders said. Congressional Quarterly said all members of the Democratic Caucus, including Sanders, “are expected to side with their party on the key cloture vote.”  Jobless Help Running Out: Jobless benefits expire at the end of December for 1.3 million Americans out of work for six months or more. On MSNBC, Sanders called it “a continuation of the Republican Party’s war on working people.” Eric Wasson of The Hill said on C-SPAN that Sanders is angry that jobless benefits are expiring.

Judge Says NSA Spying Likely Unconstitutional:  In a blistering ruling, a federal judge on Monday declared that the wholesale collection of Americans' telephone records by the National Security Agency is likely to violate the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches. Moreover, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon said, the program probably isn't effective in fighting terrorism. Sen. Bernie Sanders applauded ruling.  “In my view, the NSA is out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner,” Sanders said. “Today’s ruling is an important first step toward reining in this agency but we must go further. I will be working as hard as I can to pass the strongest legislation possible to end the abuses by the NSA and other intelligence agencies.”  In the important ruling, Judge Leon granted a preliminary injunction in favor of two men who challenged the bulk collection of phone records and said the records should be destroyed. With a government appeal almost certain, the judge stayed enforcement of his decision.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/judge-says-nsa-spying-likely-unconstitutional

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Food Safety: A bipartisan coalition of 75 lawmakers is fighting for changes to new federal food safety rules, saying the proposed requirements could be “severely detrimental” to farmers of produce and even force some out of business. The issue has shattered traditional party lines, with conservatives such as Sen. Roy Blunt “joined by liberals such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders,” the Springfield, Mo., News-Leader reported.  Budget Set for Tighter Vote in Senate: Supporters of a budget agreement worked over the weekend to secure the necessary votes in the Senate to approve the two-year deal, which they expect will pass—but by a much narrower margin than it won in the House last week. Sen. Richard Durbin said on Sunday he feels there will be strong Democratic support for the bill, but hasn't yet secured the Republican votes needed to clear a key procedural hurdle this week. Some Democrats have reservations about the bill and could vote against it because it doesn't include an extension of expiring unemployment benefits, but all are likely to vote to overcome the procedural hurdle, The Wall Street Journal reported.  Tar Sands Pipeline No Longer Needed, Oil Exec. Says: Continental Resources, one of the companies that has committed to ship crude on TransCanada Corp's proposed Keystone XL pipeline, now says the controversial pipeline is no longer needed.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate to Vote on Budget: The Senate next week will vote on a House-passed budget deal. Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized the measure because it does not extend expiring unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans out of work for six months or more. “That bothers me very much,”' he told The Wall Street Journal and The Hill, and it is one reason why he was not sure how he would vote on the bill. Letting the benefits lapse is “mean-spirited and bad economics,” Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. "In my mind, you cannot leave people in desperate economic circumstances,'' Sanders told U.S. News & World Report.   Social Security Spared: “This is a very modest proposal. It will give us a budget for two years, prevent an immediate government shutdown and, because of the partial ending of sequestration, avoid some harmful cuts to Head Start, Meals on Wheels and other important programs,” Sen. Sanders said on Vermont Public Television’s Vermont This Week program on Friday. “Further, and very importantly, despite tremendous pressure from powerful special interests this agreement does not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/121413
The Week in Review:   The Senate scheduled a vote this coming week on a budget bill that the House approved on Thursday.

The House went home for the holidays without extending unemployment benefits that run out after Christmas for 1.3 million people.  With Americans scoring our health care worse than people in other countries,  Sanders on Monday introduced legislation to provide better care at less cost to more people.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  House Passes Budget: The House on Thursday approved a budget bill. The 332-94 vote sent the measure to the Senate, where Sens. Bernie Sanders and Tom Harkin are undecided because the agreement does not include emergency unemployment benefits, according to The Hill. It is unsure that enough Senate Republicans will vote for the budget bill and avoid a government shutdown. Sanders also was disappointed that the measure fails to end corporate tax breaks and subsidies, like one that Rep. Keith Ellison mentioned on MSNBC. “Sen. Bernie Sanders and I have found $110 billion over ten years with of giveaway loopholes to the fossil fuel industry.”   Community Health Centers: Sen. Sanders met last Thursday with physicians and administrators at the Gifford Medical Center. Its designation as a community health center makes it eligible for hundreds of thousands of federal dollars, The Herald of Randolph reported. “We’re excited at what you’re doing,” Sophie Kasimow, staff director for a Senate subcommittee, said at the end of the hour-long meeting.   VA Backlog: A senior Veterans Affairs Department official predicted at a Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Sanders that a backlog of almost 400,000 claims for disability benefits will be eliminated by 2015. Sanders said that the backlog can be attributed in part to the department’s slow transition from paper to a digital records system, Military.com reported. The chairman asked VA for a report by January on improving the claims appeals process. Fierce Government reported.   Tempers Flare in Senate: If there is a rock bottom in the frayed relationship between Senate Republicans and Democrats, it seemed uncomfortably close as the final days of 2013 on Capitol Hill degenerated into something like an endurance contest to see who could be the most spiteful. Thursday brought the week’s second late-night session — called by Democrats as a way of retaliating for Republicans’ delaying tactics on confirmations — and before the senators headed in for the votes, they were angrily assigning blame. “I think it resembles fourth graders playing in a sandbox,” Sen. Lamar Alexander told The New York Times. Sen. Richard Blumenthal called this week “chaotic and confusing, and a shameful waste of time.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/121313
Rich Get Richer, Poor Get Poorer: A study by economist Emmanuel Saez shows that from 2002 to 2012 the income for the bottom 90 percent of income-earners decreased by 10.7 percent, while the income for those in the top 0.01 percent increased by 76.2 percent.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   House to Vote on Budget: The House of Representatives votes today on a bipartisan budget agreement that would avoid another budget showdown until 2015. “We have protected again Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,” Sanders told Ed Shultz in a radio interview on Wednesday. Sanders welcomed the decision to reject proposed cuts in the retirement and health care programs, The Washington Post online and Congressional Quarterly.     VA Backlog: The Veterans Affairs Department’s top benefits official predicted Wednesday at a Senate hearing chaired by Sen. Sanders that a backlog of almost 400,000 benefits claims is on course to be eliminated in 2015, Military Times reported. Sanders pointed to instances of high error rates, The Washington Examiner reported. “Reducing the backlog at the expense of accuracy is not acceptable,” Sanders said.   Health Care: Former Secretary of State Colin Powell strongly endorsed universal health care, according to a Think Progress report which noted that Sen. Sanders introduced a bill Monday that would require states to implement a single-payer system to cover every American, McKnight's Long-Term Care News reported.   Citizens United: A group in Maine opposed to unlimited third-party spending in elections plans to urge the Legislature to call for a rare national constitutional convention to overturn the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling. The effort could galvanize support for a constitutional amendment. Sen. Sanders and Rep. Ted Deutch have proposed such an amendment to overturn the ruling, the Bangor Daily News reported.

Budget Pact Protects Social Security and Medicare: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/budget-pact-protects-social-security-and-medicare_
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Budget Deal a Victory for Social Security, Sanders Says: House and Senate negotiators on Thursday reached a budget deal that would replace some of the harmful sequester cuts set for the coming year. In an interview on MSNBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders celebrated the deal as a victory for Social Security. “As the founder of the Defending Social Security Caucus, I am extremely pleased that we have once again been able to beat back ferocious efforts to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.   Unemployment Benefits: The budget deal doesn’t address the pending expiration later this month of emergency benefits for the long-term unemployed. “When long-term unemployment is a very, very serious problem, to my mind you just cannot leave people out there in desperate economic conditions,” Sen. Sanders told The Wall Street Journal as he left a briefing on the budget deal. He did not say, however, that failure to include a renewal of the emergency program would mean he would vote against the budget deal. “I’m going to do everything I can to see that we get it,” he told National Journal.   Federal Worker Pensions: New civilian employees hired after Jan. 1 would have to pay more toward their federal pensions under the budget deal that also would trim benefits for some military retirees. Sanders told Congressional Quarterly increase in pension contributions by federal employees is a “terrible” idea, but so is sequestration, the across the board cuts that the budget pact will mitigate. “You have bad and worse. I have to decide which is worse,” said Sanders, a member of the budget conference.   Health Care: Sen. Sanders says the difficult rollout of the Affordable Care Act and the complexity of the new law highlight the need to adopt a streamlined single-payer health system. “What we need to do is move toward a simple system, a non-bureaucratic system which says health care is a right,” Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. The American Health Security Act that Sanders introduced on Monday would require states to create their own single-payer insurance systems, WCAX-TV and The Thom Hartmann Program reported. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell endorsed moving toward a single-payer system, U.S. News & World Report reported.

Budget Pact:  Key congressional budget negotiators reached agreement Tuesday evening on a two-year plan to restore about $63 billion in automatic spending cuts.  Sen. Bernie Sanders is a member of the special Senate and House budget committee, which still must go along with the deal before the full House and Senate consider the legislation. Interviewed by Chris Hayes on MSNBC not long after the agreement was outlined, Sanders assessed the pros – no cuts in Social Security or Medicare, Saturday mail survives – and the cons – corporations keep their tax loopholes, no jobs program, no extension of expiring benefits for the long-term unemployed.

Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced legislation to provide health care for every American through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. Rep.

Better Health Care for More People at Less Cost:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced legislation to provide health care for every American through a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system to provide better care for more patients at less cost. Rep. Jim McDermott has filed a companion bill in the House.  Sanders supported the Affordable Care Act, but in an interview with The Daily Beast he called the health care law passed in 2010 “only a modest step forward toward dealing with the dysfunction of the American health-care system.”  Even under the new law, Sanders added, insurance companies, drug companies and medical equipment suppliers will be able to rake off billions of dollars in profits rather than devoting those resources to providing health care.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders Introduces Single-Payer Bill in Senate: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced the American Health Security Act, which would require each state to set up a single-payer health care system and undo the private insurance exchanges that have plagued Obamacare. Meanwhile, state-led efforts in Vermont, Massachusetts and elsewhere could sweep the country statehouse by statehouse as soon as lawmakers see the advantage of a single-payer system.  “As the president fully understands, the rollout has been a disaster, the website has been a disaster,” said Sanders. “But the truth is, even if all of those problems were corrected tomorrow and if the Affordable Care Act did all that it was supposed to do, it would be only a modest step forward to dealing with the dysfunction of the American health care system,” Sanders told The Daily Beast.   Unemployment Insurance in Jeopardy: Unemployment insurance benefits for 1.3 million long-term unemployed Americans will expire at the end of the month if Congress fails to pass an extension. “We have got to create millions of jobs and we have got to pass legislation to protect the long-term unemployed,” Sen. Sanders said Monday on MSNBC.  Raise the Minimum Wage: Calling for passage of a bill he cosponsored to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10, Sen. Sanders disputed opponents’ claims that employers would slash payrolls. “They’re just factually wrong. In my state of Vermont, our minimum wage is $8.60 compared to the national minimum wage of $7.25. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in America. You have states where there is virtually no minimum wage at all, and their unemployment rate is much higher. The facts just don’t bear it out. The reality is that if we raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour about 30 million Americans would get a pay raise, and 88 percent of them are adults. These are not kids. These are working families struggling to keep their heads above water. They need a pay raise. We’ve gotta pass it,” Sanders said on MSNBC.   Tax Breaks for Corporations: States are increasingly offering lucrative tax breaks to big corporations in interstate competition for jobs. Sen. Sanders would block so-called "megadeals" given to major transnational corporations at the federal level, The Thom Hartmann Program reported.

An Offer They Can't Refuse: http://youtu.be/nq46hA3Hr8Q
Long-Term Unemployment:
 
 More than 1.3 million Americans without jobs for six months or more face an unemployment insurance cutoff at the end of December. As the impact continues to be felt from worst recession since the 1930s, Sen. Bernie Sanders joined 31 other senators who signed a letter urging Congress to preserve federal unemployment insurance for another year.
 
 While the official 7 percent unemployment rate in November was the lowest in five years, long-term unemployment remained near record highs. Altogether some 4 million Americans, more than one-third of all those who are unemployed, have been jobless for six months or more. 
 
 The immediate threat affects about 1.3 million workers who would lose benefits if Congress lets an emergency program expire in the days after Christmas. Another 1.9 million would have their benefits cut later in the year. (Some 600 Vermonters face an immediate cutoff after Dec. 28, and 2,300 more Vermonters could lose benefits later in 2014, according to the National Employment Law Project.) A new study by the same group showed that federal unemployment insurance keeps workers in the job hunt and families out of poverty.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Congress Readies a Year-End Dash: Congress gets a late chance this week to end the year with an elusive budget deal and to make headway on other fronts. In the final week of 2013 that the Senate and House are scheduled to be in Washington at the same time, lawmakers and aides are optimistic that negotiators can reach a budget accord and continue to make progress on a farm bill and other measures. Meanwhile, a Senate rule change pushed through by Democrats should help ease the way for confirmation of several of President Obama's executive-branch and judicial nominees, The Wall Street Journal reported.  Budget Deal Near: House and Senate negotiators were putting the finishing touches Sunday on what would be the first successful budget accord since 2011, when the battle over a soaring national debt first paralyzed Washington. The deal expected to be sealed this week on Capitol Hill would not significantly reduce the debt, now $17.3 trillion and rising. It would not close corporate tax loopholes or reform expensive health-care and retirement programs. It would not even fully replace sharp spending cuts known as the sequester, the negotiators’ primary target, The Washington Post reported.  Cell Phone Tracking: Cellphone carriers last year answered at least 1.1 million requests from law enforcement agencies seeking information on caller locations, text messages and other data for use in investigations, according to reports from the carriers in response to a request from Sen. Edward J. Markey. He wants the Federal Communications Commission to limit the amount of time carriers could hold on to customers’ personal information. He also would narrow the information that police collected from a cell tower when doing so-called dumps, The New York Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Energy Conference: The Thetford Energy Committee was honored Saturday at a statewide energy conference for a home weatherization program. “I am here because I respect enormously the work that you are doing,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. He called climate change “the issue of our day,” but said government has been slow to respond. “If we’re going to transform our energy system, it’s not going to come from Washington or Paris or London, it’s going to come from the grassroots and people knocking on doors,” he added in the Valley News.  Single Payer: The biggest downside of the Affordable Care Act is the reliance on the private insurance industry. It does not have to be this way, however. The law includes a provision that can open the door for states to institute their own single-payer healthcare system. Vermont — home of Ben and Jerry’s, Maple Syrup, Bernie Sanders and the first state to pass marriage equality — decided to set up their very own single payer system.,” according to Truth Out.  Senate May Vote on Iran Sanctions: US lawmakers are preparing a possible vote on new sanctions against Iran, a move President Barack Obama fears could sabotage the nuclear deal. Even as a six-month Geneva agreement provides for partial suspension of existing sanctions, a bipartisan group of senators led by Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Robert Menendez and Sen. Mark Kirk were set to unveil a sanctions bill, AFP reported.  Food Stamp Cuts: Top farm bill negotiators have kept mum about how close they are to finding common ground on potential policy changes and spending cuts for domestic food assistance. But advocates tracking the closed-door discussions say they have heard a figure of $8 billion in nutrition cuts over 10 years is under consideration -- double the proposed reductions in a farm bill passed by the Senate with the support of the Obama administration, Congressional Quarterly reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Remembering Mandela: Across Vermont and around the world, people are celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was active in the anti-apartheid movement while serving as mayor of Burlington, recalled chants of "Free Mandela!" ringing through the city during protests, WCAX-TV reported. He said the city divested $1.8 million in pension funds from companies doing business in South Africa. “I think we can learn something from the perseverance and determination of somebody like Nelson Mandela,” Sanders said on The Thom Hartmann Program.  Remembering Mandela: Sen. Sanders traveled to South Africa in 1994 to witness Mandela's presidential inauguration. Sanders said Mandela was a powerful force for good in the struggle to dismantle the terrible legacy of apartheid, Vermont Public Radio reported. "It was, in a sense, hard for people to believe what they had achieved. These people had been brutalized and terrorized by a white government under apartheid. And to suddenly see their hero, their leader, being sworn in as president of their country was incredible," Sanders told WPTZ-TV.  Unemployment: Sen. Sanders welcomed a Labor Department report that put unemployment at 7 percent in November, a five-year low, but noted that real unemployment was 13.2 percent counting those who gave up looking for work and others who had to settle for part-time jobs. On the Thom Hartmann Program on Friday, Sanders also said that he and 31 other senators were working to prevent more than 1.3 million long-term unemployed workers from losing benefits at the end of December.  AIDS Protest: Students from St. Michael's College marched down Burlington's Church Street Friday to the offices of Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy to call attention to the fight against AIDS, WCAX-TV and WPTZ-TV reported. The students thanked Sanders for his commitment and work to secure funding to fight the problem.

The Week in Review:   Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid leader who became South Africa’s first black president, died on Thursday. Admiring Mandela’s “perseverance and determination and incredible courage,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said he was saddened by the passing on one of the leading world figures of the past century. In the United States, a new report on Friday said the official unemployment rate was 7 percent last month but that number told only half the story. Among those who held jobs but struggled to make ends meet were fast-food workers who staged a one-day strike on Thursday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Nelson Mandela, 95: Nelson Mandela, who led South Africa from white minority rule and became his country’s first black president, died Thursday night. Sen. Bernard Sanders attended Mandela's inauguration in 1994, a moment he called "inspiring,” the Los Angeles Times reported.  Sanders said Mandela’s “lifelong devotion to equality and fairness serves as a lesson for all of us about the power of determination and the force of dignity,” the Burlington Free Press, WPTZ-TV and WCAX-TV reported.  VA Health Care: Sen. Sanders wants to bring more veterans into the Veterans Affairs health system by expanding eligibility for dental and health services. Many veterans have serious oral health problems but can’t get treated at the VA because those cavities, broken teeth and other issues aren’t related to their experience in the military. “Dental care should be considered health care,” Sanders told the Valley News during a stop on Thursday at the White River Junction VA.   Community Health Center: The Arlington Family Practice will become a part of the Battenkill Valley Health Center in March of 2014, which was designated a federally qualified health center this fall. Sen. Sanders visited the board in Arlington on Tuesday, The Manchester Journal reported. The public is invited to attend a community event at the center on Saturday. Dr. Elizabeth Wennar Rosenberg, a board member, worked to help secure the funding. She told the Bennington Banner that the application was fiercely competitive but “by the grace of God and Bernie Sanders working down there in Washington D.C., he got the funding.”   Strike for Living Wage: Fast-food workers nationwide went on strike Thursday in protest of insufficient wages and income inequality. Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alan Grayson are a few of the progressives advocating for working class families and pushing back against big money interests in party politics, AmericaBlog reported.

Nelson Mandela, 95:  Former South African President Nelson Mandela died Thursday at 95. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he was deeply saddened by the passing of one of the outstanding leaders of the 20th century. “In his native South Africa, he was a powerful force for good in the struggle to dismantle the terrible legacy of apartheid. Around the world, his lifelong devotion to equality and fairness serves as a lesson for all of us about the power of determination and the force of dignity.
 
 “Like many in Vermont, I was active in the anti-apartheid movement. It was inspiring for me to be at Mandela’s presidential inauguration in 1994 and to witness first-hand a truly great figure at a pivotal point in history,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Wage: As fast-food workers plan another one-day strike on Thursday in cities around the country, President Barack Obama vowed Wednesday to focus his final three years in office on income inequality in the U.S., and called for an increase in the federal minimum wage. Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts that the president should rally the American people to demand a minimum-wage increase. In a radio interview on The Ed Schultz Show, Sanders said the president and the public should put real pressure on the “do-nothing” Congress to take action.  Community Health Centers: Sen. Sanders announced Wednesday that three new community health centers will come to the state in Arlington, Bristol and Randolph. The centers provide both medical and dental care. Nearly 160,000 Vermonters, one-quarter of the state’s total population, utilize the health center network giving Vermont one of the highest participation rates in the country, Sanders said on WPTZ-TV. “If American moves as aggressively as Vermont does, the health care outcomes will be a hell of a lot better and we think we’re going to save money as well,” Sanders said on Vermont Public Radio. The new centers bring the total in the state to 11, WCAX-TV reported.  Social Security: “As budget negotiations grind on inconclusively in Washington, let us make the case for deficit reduction — by increasing Social Security benefits. The deficit we have in mind is the growing gap between what millions of Americans need for retirement income and what they will have available when the time comes ... [Sen. Elizabeth Warren] argues, correctly we think, that modest adjustments to the program would keep it solvent for many years, and even allow for expanded benefits, something a few senators, including Sanders, are advocating,” according to a Valley News editorial.  Sanders for President?: Sen. Sanders says he is considering a run for the White House in order to bring important political issues to the foreground which "too many in Congress ignore," according to WPTZ-TV. "Bernie's a viable presence, if not necessarily a viable candidate," observed University of Vermont political scientist Garrison Nelson. "I think he's frustrated by the compromises that the Obama people have made in order to placate Republicans."  Continue reading here: http://sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/120513/
A Health Care Success Story:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday brought together leaders of community health centers from across Vermont where three new centers opening in January are part of a dramatic expansion of affordable primary care. A Sanders provision in the Affordable Care Act authorized $11 billion to build, expand, and operate community health centers throughout the United States. “This is a huge step forward,” said Sanders, chairman of a Senate subcommittee that oversees primary health care.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  End Big Oil Tax Breaks: As congressional budget negotiators look for ways to lower deficits, Sen. Sanders and Rep. Keith Ellison have introduced a bill that would cut tax subsidies to oil, gas and coal industries. Ellison said the bill would cut tax breaks, close loopholes and end taxpayer-funded fossil fuel research. This is a long shot, despite estimated savings of $100 billion-plus over 10 years, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The fossil fuel lobby helped end some ethanol subsidies. Ethanol blends accounts for about 10 percent of U.S. gasoline sales. The White House 2014 budget proposal calls for eliminating several of the provisions cited in the Sanders-Ellison bill.  F-35s: The Air Force announced on Tuesday that it will base F-35 fighter planes with the Vermont Air National Guard at Burlington International Airport. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders, Rep. Peter Welch and Gov. Peter Shumlin said the plane is important to the state’s economy, The Associated Press and vtdigger.org reported. “The Air Force decision to base its newest generation of planes in Burlington is a tribute to the Vermont Air National Guard,” Leahy, Sanders and Welch said in a joint statement published in Tuesday’s Burlington Free Press and Air Force Times. The first F-35As are scheduled to arrive in 2020, My Champlain Valley reported.   Sanders Congratulates Health Center: Sen. Sanders congratulated members of the Battenkill Valley Health Center Board for their hard work and persistence Tuesday and encouraged the group to execute bold and innovative ideas in the future.  The meeting came nearly one month after it was announced that the center was chosen to receive a federal grant in the amount of $775,000 and would become the first federally qualified health center in the county, the Bennington Banner and The Manchester Journal reported.   Health Care: Sen. Sanders says states are beginning to see that the Affordable Care Act can work as more Americans sign up for health insurance, Politicus USA reported. Republicans, he said, “have nothing to say... all they can do is play the anti-Obamacare card and hope it fails.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/120413

Break Up Big Banks:   The number of U.S. banks has fallen to 6,891, the least since 1934 when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. – created in the wake of the Great Depression – began keeping track. The decline is from a peak of more than 18,000, according to a Wall Street Journal article published on Tuesday. The acceleration of the unwelcome trend was predicted as long ago as 1999 by then Rep. Bernie Sanders. The House that summer was considering a bill to allow commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies to merge by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. Sanders predicted that such a massive deregulation of the financial services industry would lead to fewer banks and financial service providers; increased charges and fees for individual consumers and small businesses; diminished credit for rural America and taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail. “It will lead to more mega-mergers; a small number of corporations dominating the financial service industry; and further concentration of economic power in our country,” Sanders said.  Nevertheless, the bill passed.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/break-up-big-banks-2013
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Health Care: Federal officials said they had largely succeeded in repairing parts of the federal insurance website that had not worked well during the two months since its troubled launch. “There is no question that the federal website is making substantial progress,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC Monday. Sanders said Republicans attacking the Affordable Care Act's failures “have nothing to say” when it comes to finding coverage for the 48 million uninsured Americans. The best cure, he stressed, would be a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system to provide better health care to more people at less cost.   Veterans Clinics: Sen. Sanders is coming to Bennington, Vt., today. The Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs chairman wants to visit the VA outpatient clinic on North Street, WNYT-TV in Albany, N.Y., reported.  Sanders Leapfrogs to Top: Sen. Sanders’ recent comments about the presidential race in 2016 have generated more online buzz than any other candidate according to U.S. News & World Report. Citing data from TrendPo, a D.C.-based political analytics startup, the magazine allowed that online buzz is not the same as being ahead in the polls, but shows that Sanders is getting more news mentions and attracting a greater following than others on social media.   Sanders Makes a Point: “Sanders has been a consistent and authentic spokesman for an important point of view that has grown ever more germane as the economy has proven Sanders’ warnings to have been prescient … [H]e has promised he would not carry on a campaign if there were a chance a third candidate in the race would benefit the Republican. Instead he wants to make a point, which has been the point throughout his career,” the Rutland Herald and Times Argus wrote in editorials.

A Health Care Cure: The online health-insurance marketplace now works for almost all users. “The Republican nightmare is that the Affordable Care Act is working” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on Monday on MSNBC. Millions of Americans who never had health insurance may now be covered. Community health centers that provide affordable primary and dental care are being expanded. He called the Affordable Care Act an important step forward. An even better long-term solution, he stressed, would be a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system to provide better health care to more people at less cost.  Watch Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama Feels Heat from Left: As President Obama struggles to achieve his second-term domestic agenda, a more liberal and populist voice is emerging within a Democratic Party already looking ahead to the next presidential election, according to a Sunday Washington Post article that mentioned Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. If Sanders runs for the White House, the Post said, “he could serve as an agitator who pulled other candidates to the left.”   National Health Services Corps Expands: The U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration reported last week that 8,900 health professionals are now serving about 9.3 million Americans in programs supported by the National Health Service Corps. That's more than double the number of providers as recently as 2008 when Sen. Sanders added $284 million to the Affordable Care Act for the program that provides medical education loan repayment for young medical professionals who provide primary care services in medically underserved areas of the U.S., according to a blog by John McDonough posted by The Boston Globe.   Farmers Markets: Jenny Nelson works on agriculture policy and rural development for Sen. Sanders. She helped pursue some of the grant money for the Green Mountain Farm Direct lunchbox program based in Newport, Vt. “We were more than happy to help because the senator feels so strongly about local foods, about helping small farms find markets, and to have access to local food for everybody,” Nelson told WCAX-TV.   Hire Veterans: Newport Furniture Parts has increased emphasis on showing the company’s appreciation of veterans and has ramped up a campaign to encourage veterans to apply for work. Human Resources Manager Kevin Deslauriers recently attended a roundtable discussion in Washington D.C. with Sen. Sanders and the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee. “We want to show our appreciation for those who served our country,” Deslauriers told the Newport Daily Express. “It’s an opportunity for employment and our way to say more than thank you; come be a part of our family.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/120213
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Rising Populism: MSNBC's Steve Kornacki described a rising populist movement in the Democratic caucus by citing Sen. Sanders' questioning of CBO Director Doug Elmendorf as evidence. Sanders questioned Emendorf during a budget conference committee saying, "The reason we're in a deficit today is because of two unpaid wars, a Medicare Part D program unpaid for and trillions in tax breaks that went to the wealthy.”  White House '16: Sen. Sanders recently said he's open to a presidential bid if no other progressive candidate steps up. "Under normal times, it's fine, you have a moderate Democrat running, a moderate Republican running," Sanders told the Burlington Free Press. "These are not normal times. The United States right now is in the middle of a severe crisis and you have to call it what it is," National Public Radio reported.  Black Friday Protests: Thousands of Walmart workers and their supporters in the trade union movement have begun a nationwide series of Black Friday rallies against America's largest private employer, protesting against wages and conditions they say are so low that many employees are forced to rely on government assistance, The Guardian reported.  Life on Minimum Wage: According to a study released in October, only 13 percent of fast-food workers get health-insurance benefits at work. Meanwhile, executive pay and profits in the industry are on the rise. Last winter, Bloomberg News determined that it would take a Chicago McDonald’s worker who earns $8.25 an hour more than a century on the clock to match the $8.75 million that the company’s chief executive made in 2011, The New York Times reported.

Sen. Sanders talks about his fight for a fair budget: http://youtu.be/AWW8czVcRxY
The Week in Review:   This week Sen. Bernie Sanders praised Pope Francis for condemning the unrestrained capitalism that has caused income inequality and poverty around the world. Pope Francis warned that our economic systems will “devour everything which stands in the way of increased profits, whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenseless before the interests of a deified market.”  Later in the week, CBS’ 60 Minutes aired a critique Sen. Sanders made of the program’s recent report called The Giving Pledge. In the report, 60 Minutes applauded billionaires such as Pete Peterson for their so-called philanthropy. Sanders wrote to 60 Minutes saying, "What Pete Peterson has done is throw hundreds of millions of dollars into lobbying campaigns to cut Social Security, Medicare and disabled veterans’ benefits. That, to my mind, is not philanthropy.” In an interview with MSNBC this week Sen. Sanders discussed his work on the budget conference committee saying “Poll after poll shows that large profitable corporations have got to contribute to help reduce the deficit.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-112913
Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  Sanders Praises Pope Francis: Sen. Bernie Sanders is praising this week’s statement from Pope Francis warning of the ‘‘new tyranny’’ of unrestrained capitalism. Sanders says he agrees with the Catholic leader’s call for curbing ‘‘the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation.’’ Both men say such policies worsen poverty and the divide between rich and poor, The Associated Press reported.   N.S.A. Spied From Ottawa: Canadian opposition politicians expressed shock and anger on Thursday over a report that the National Security Agency conducted widespread surveillance during G-20 and G-8 summits in Canada in June 2010, The New York Times reported.   Doctor Shortage: Medicaid has struggled with a shortage of doctors willing to accept its low reimbursement rates and red tape, forcing many patients to wait for care. In just five weeks, millions of additional Americans will be covered by the program, many of them older people with an array of health problems, The New York Times reported.   Filibuster Reform: The decision by Senate Democrats to eliminate filibusters for most judicial nominations only marginally enhanced President Obama’s power to reshape the judiciary, according to court watchers from across the political spectrum, because Republican senators can still veto his nominees to most currently vacant appeals court seats, The New York Times reported.

Happy Thanksgiving.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders or the Pope: This week Pope Francis called for a rejection of the “new idolatry of money." MSNBC's Ed Schultz commented that "The Pope sounds more like senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren than Ronald Reagan and Paul Ryan."  Food Safety: Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration asking for a re-write of food safety rules "in a way that enhances food safety and the continued strength of Vermont's agricultural sector," Politico reported.  Autism Speaks: Amy Cohen, the director of Howard Center's Autism Spectrum Program, received a national award in appreciation of her advocacy on behalf of individuals with autism in Vermont, the Burlington Free Press reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Pope Rejects 'New Idolatry of Money': Pope Francis this week released his first independently written apostolic exhortation, calling for a rejection of the "new idolatry of money," the Burlington Free Press reported. Francis notes that the earnings of a rich minority are growing exponentially. Sen. Bernie Sanders applauded the pope on Tuesday for criticizing a "cult of money" that has led to a widening gap between the rich and poor, OpEd News reported.  Budget Priorities: Creating jobs and repairing an ailing economy should be top priorities in the ongoing budget negotiations, Sen. Sanders said Tuesday on MSNBC. "People legitimately are concerned about the deficit. We all are. But what people are concerned about even more is that real unemployment, counting those people who have given up looking for work, and those people who are working part time when they want to work full time, that real unemployment in this country is close to 14 percent," Sanders said.  Sanders Supports De Blasio Tax Plan: Sen. Sanders told WAMC-AM on Tuesday he supports New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio’s plan to hike taxes on the rich to pay for educational reforms. "Number one, it is totally appropriate to start asking the wealthiest people of this country to start paying their fair share of taxes. And number two, one of the important areas we should be investing in is our children," Sanders said.  Filibuster Reform: In a wide-ranging interview with Salon.com, Sen. Sanders discussed the Senate’s recent filibuster reform saying “It is a significant step forward in attempting to end the dysfunctionality of the United States Senate.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Stopping Corporate Welfare: All the welfare that the U.S. government provides to real, live human beings pales in comparison to the billions and billions in handouts to corporations and big-business, The Thom Hartmann Program and Think Progress reported, such as approximately $52 billion to Big Oil.  Sen. Sanders and Rep. Keith Ellision have proposed legislation to end this corporate welfare at taxpayer expense. "At a time when fossil fuel companies are racking up record profits, it is time to end the absurdity of American taxpayers providing massive subsidies to these hugely profitable fossil fuel corporations,” Sanders said.   The ABLE Act: A bicameral group in Congress is lobbying for the passage of the The Achieving a Better Life Experience Act by the end of the year, The Hill reported. The bill aims to provide the disability community with the chance to provide and save for themselves through tax-free savings accounts, and it has earned bipartisan support in Congress, ranging from Sen. Sanders to Sen. Mark Rubio in the Senate.   Protect Local Farms: Vermont lawmakers criticized FDA’s produce safety and preventive controls regulations for threatening to “disrupt Vermont’s small, local and diversified farmers and food hubs with large fees and expensive testing and booking requirements,” in a Nov. 22 statement, Food Chemical News reported. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy, along with Rep. Welch have urged the FDA to rewrite the Food Safety Modernization Act.   American Anxiety: American workers are living with unprecedented economic anxiety, four years into a recovery that has left so many of them stuck in place. More than six in 10 workers in a recent Washington Post-Miller Center poll worry that they will lose their jobs to the economy, surpassing concerns in more than a dozen surveys dating to the 1970s. Nearly one in three say they worry “a lot” about losing their jobs, also a record high, according to the joint survey, which explores Americans’ changing definition of success and their confidence in the country’s future, The Washington Post reported.

One ‘Entitlement’ Really Does Need Trimming - Sam Pizzigati, Common Dreams:   Deck the halls, this holiday season, with scenes of hunger.A new report neatly exposes the monumental hypocrisy of America’s most politically active corporate leaders.  Struggling families all across America now have less food on their tables. Budget cuts that kicked into effect November 1 have lowered the nation’s average federal food stamp benefit to less than $1.40 per person per meal.  Austerity American-style is squeezing elsewhere as well. Seventy percent of local agencies that service seniors have had to cut back on Meals on Wheels deliveries. The “sequestration” federal budget cuts that began this past March have also shut out 57,000 preschoolers from Head Start.  More cuts are looming, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill near still another budget deliberation deadline, this one midway through December. The next federal program in the cross-hairs? Maybe the biggest of them all: Social Security.  Average Americans, of course, don’t want Social Security cut. Over three-quarters of Americans, polling shows, oppose any Social Security cutbacks.

Pete Peterson a Philanthropist? http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-giving-pledge
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Pete Peterson a Philanthropist?: Sen. Sanders commented on a 60 Minutes report about billionaire's pledging to give half of their wealth to charity writing "'60 minutes' calls Wall Street billionaire Pete Peterson a philanthropist. What Pete Peterson has done is throw hundreds of millions of dollars into lobbying campaigns to cut Social Security, Medicare and disabled veterans' benefits. That, to my mind, is not philanthropy," CBS’s 60 Minutes reported.   Rallying Americans: Sen. Sanders refuses to entertain cuts in earned benefit programs when it comes to the issue of balancing the budget. In a three-day trip to the South last month, Sanders held town hall meetings, visited community health clinics and high schools and other events organized by labor unions and progressive groups, the Times Argus and Rutland Herald reported.   Climate Talks: After eleventh-hour negotiations, delegates at international climate talks in Warsaw could agree to only a broad set of terms aimed at setting world nations on a path toward a 2015 global warming accord. The U.S. and other countries agreed Saturday that, by early 2015, they will put forward their individual plans for lowering emissions, a move that gives nations less than a year to review the plans before key December 2015 talks in Paris, Politico reported.   Medicaid for the Homeless: Today, most state Medicaid programs cover only disabled adults or those with dependents, so millions of deeply impoverished Americans are left without access to the program. But starting Jan. 1, President Obama’s health care law will expand Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes under 138 percent of the federal poverty line, and enrollment is expected to increase by about nine million next year, The New York Times reported.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Iran Agrees to Freeze Nuclear Program: Iran struck a historic deal Sunday with the United States and five other world powers, agreeing to a temporary freeze of its nuclear program in the most significant agreement between Washington and Tehran in more than three decades of estrangement. President Obama hailed the agreement, which commits Iran to curb its nuclear activities for six months in exchange for limited and gradual sanctions relief, including access to $4.2 billion from oil sales. The six-month period will give diplomats time to negotiate a more sweeping agreement, The Associated Press reported.  Filibuster Reform: “The move by Senate Democrats to limit filibusters on presidential appointments is only a first step in ending a procedural abuse that unfairly tips the balance of power toward the minority … The solution is to restore the filibuster to its full glory. In December 2010, Sen. Sanders spoke for 8½ hours against President Obama’s tax cut deal, now known as “filibernie” … Sanders at least gave Americans a glimpse of what a true filibuster might look like. If a senator wants to block legislation and his side lacks the votes to defeat the bill, then let him or her stand up and speak for as long as he or she is physically able,” the Burlington Free Press said in an editorial.  Budget Conference: Members of the House-Senate budget conference committee are narrowing the focus of their negotiations to a plan that would provide some sequester relief and new discretionary spending levels for appropriators for two years, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Although top aides caution that Democrats and Republicans do not have a deal yet, the spending targets and the provisions under discussion suggest leaders of the conference committee have set their sights on an outline for a limited agreement that would create budgeting stability through 2015 while setting aside larger and more contentious questions, Congressional Quarterlyreported.

Bills Blocked by Republican Filibusters: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/bills-blocked-by-republican-filibusters
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Filibuster Reform: Senate Democrats this week approved a rules change that would restrict the use of the filibuster to Supreme Court nominations and legislation. Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday on MSNBC he hopes the move will allow the Senate to confirm the president’s nominees and move on to the pressing business of dealing with jobs and unemployment. He called the reform “long overdue” in a radio interview Friday with Ed Schultz. “The Senate is now dysfunctional. I suspect pretty soon we’ll be debating whether to turn the lights on or have microphones.” Sanders will be a guest Sunday on CNN’’s State of the Union, The Associated Press reported.  Republican Obstructionism: The filibuster was designed to ensure debate. No one is trying to outlaw drama on the Senate floor, Mike Littwin wrote in a Colorado Independent column citing Sen. Sanders’ long speech in 2010 against the Bus tax cuts. But he said the routine abuse of Senate rules for plain obstructionism was what forced the rules change.  The Senate’s two independents, Sanders and Angus King, sided with all but three Democrats in the 52-48 vote to change the rules, The Hill reported. AP and WPTZ-TV said Sanders and Sen. Patrick Leahy backed the rules change.  End Polluter Welfare: Sen. Sanders this week reintroduced a comprehensive bill to eliminate tax incentives and other breaks for fossil energy companies, The Hill, Politico, Law 360 and Environment & Energy Daily reported.   NRC Lax Oversight of Nuclear Power Industry: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission had agreed to look into Entergy’s finances to determine if the corporation that operates Vermont Yankee and other plants was solvent enough to run its reactors safely in accordance with the NRC rules and regulations. But Entergy bullied the federal agency into not doing its job. Sens. Sanders and Ed Markey and Sanders voiced “grave concerns,” according to a column in the Bennington Banner.

The Week in Review:   The Senate on Thursday effectively ended the filibuster as a way to block presidential nominees. Now a simple majority will end debate and clear the way for Senate confirmation votes on most of the president’s picks for court and cabinet posts. Sen. Bernie Sanders supported the change. He said the shift was forced by Republican senators abusing the rules since President Obama took office.  Earlier in the week, Sanders’ Senate subcommittee on aging held a hearing into whether poverty is a death sentence. And on Thursday, the president signed a Sanders bill to help veterans.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Filibuster Reform Doesn’t Go Far Enough, Sanders Says: Senators on Thursday voted to make it harder for the minority to block confirmation of the president's nominees for judges and other top posts. Sen. Bernie Sanders voted for the measure to change Senate rules so 51 votes, not an extraordinary 60 votes, are needed to end a filibuster, WCAX-TV and the Burlington Free Press reported. “We have got to move forward. This country is in trouble. The American people deserve action,” Sanders said on MSNBC. On Crossfire on CNN, Sanders was asked if the Senate may change its rules to allow majority rule on legislation, not just nominees. “Let me be very frank with you. That's exactly what I believe,” Sanders said.   Single Payer: The botched implementation of Obamacare has created a bittersweet moment for advocates of a universal, single-payer health care system: They saw this coming, but they can't gloat about it. Sen. Sanders, a vocal single-payer supporter, told The Huffington Post that “what's happening now just reinforces to me that what we need is a simple system focused on providing health care.” he said. Under the complex system created by the Affordable Care Act, Sanders added, “its main function is to enable insurance companies, drug companies, medical equipment suppliers to be making huge amounts of money off of the system. The more complex it is, the easier it is for them to do that.”   Poor Die Younger: Americans in some poor neighborhoods have lower life expectancy than those in countries like Ethiopia and Sudan, according to research presented at a Wednesday hearing held by Sen. Sanders, WCAX-TV, Times Argus, The Caledonian-Record and The Raw Story reported.  “Stress and poverty, wondering how I’m going to feed my family tomorrow, pay my bills, get the income I need to survive, takes a toll on human life,” said Sanders.   Obama Signs Sanders Veterans COLA Bill: President Obama on Thursday signed into law a measure providing a 1.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment to disabled veterans and their survivors. The increase takes effect Dec. 1 and will first appear in the January checks of more than 5 million beneficiaries. Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and sponsored the 2013 COLA bill, attached a provision to the bill that has long raised complaints from veterans: The COLA is no longer rounded down to the next lower dollar as a money-saving gimmick. “These seemingly small amounts of money add up over time and will contribute to the financial stability of millions of veterans and their survivors,” Sanders said, according to Military Times.

Majority Rule in the Senate: http://youtu.be/wW1BYtA1m2Q  Senators on Thursday voted to make it harder for the minority to block confirmation of the president's nominees for judges and other top posts.  "Most Americans grew up believing that in America the majority rules," Sen. Bernie Sanders said. "They also believe that this country deserves a Senate which is not dysfunctional and unable to address the needs of the American people. Unfortunately, in recent years the Republican minority has engaged in an unprecedented level of obstructionism. They have used the filibuster hundreds of times to delay or block the president’s nominees and to stop legislation from even being considered. Today’s decision by the Senate to let the majority rule on votes to confirm judges, cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials is a step in the right direction toward ending dysfunction in Senate."

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Poor Americans Die Younger: Sen. Bernie Sanders held a hearing Wednesday on disparities in life expectancy between regions of the United States, The Associated Press, The Charleston (W. Va.) Gazette, The Nation, Congressional Quarterly and The Raw Story reported. “The lower people’s income, the earlier they die and the sicker they live,” testified Dr. Steven Woolf, who directs the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University.   Economic Populism: Rachel Maddow said “economic populism” espoused by Sens. Sanders, Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren “is on the offensive.” She interviewed Warren about expanding Social Security.   Democrats Expected to Curb Filibuster Rules Soon: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is rallying Democrats to pass new rules easing the confirmation process for executive-branch nominations and for many federal judges. Reid now has the needed 51 votes to change the rules, said Sen. Michael Bennet, a member of the Senate Democratic leadership. He said it was "a real possibility'' that Reid would call a vote on Thursday. The change would curb the minority party's main source of leverage in the Senate's frequent battles over confirming the president's nominees to executive and most judicial posts, The Wall Street Journal reported.   Far Fewer Homeless Veterans: The number of homeless veterans and people who have been homeless for at least a year has dropped significantly, according to the latest survey by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. USA Today reported that the number of homeless veterans fell 24 percent over the past six years, to 57,850, and the number of chronically homeless people decreased 25 percent to 92,590. Overall, there were 610,040 homeless people in the U.S., a 9 percent drop from 2007, according to the annual count of the homeless. The number of homeless families, which shot up during the recession, also decreased 8 percent since 2007 to 222,200, the report shows.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)  Senate Panel Votes to Expand Veterans Health and Dental Care: The Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs on Tuesday approved a measure that will expand access to VA health benefits. “One of the concerns that I have is that there are many veterans who would like to access VA health care who for one reason or another are unable to do so,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chairman, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday with the Vermont Press Bureau. A separate Sanders bill approved by the committee would expand veterans’ access to dental care.   VA Shutdown Protection: The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee moved Tuesday to protect all veterans programs from a future government shutdown. The measure enjoys wide support from veterans’ groups but the Obama administration and a few members of Congress are not on board. The committee approved the bill on a 13-1 vote. Sen. Richard Burr, the ranking Republican, was the lone opponent. The shift would provide the VA with more flexibility in its spending priorities, Sanders told the Vermont Press Bureau.   Bank Slapped with Record Fine: JPMorgan Chase agreed Tuesday to a record $13-billion settlement with the government over selling shoddy mortgage investments. The nation's largest bank admitted to knowingly peddling the toxic securities that led to the housing bubble and the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression. Sen. Sanders told the Los Angeles Times that he was pleased officials were taking action. "We continue to be in the midst of a terrible, terrible economic downturn because of the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street," Sanders said. "People want justice to be done.”   Minimum Wage: Senate Democrats are backing a proposal to lift the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour. Sen. Sanders told Ring of Fire Radio's Robert Kennedy Jr. that the bill would increase the amount of money flowing into the hands of low-income workers who are more likely to purchase goods and services that create jobs. “This bill will give 30 million workers a raise and that is something we have to do,” Sanders said on WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/112013
Senate Panel Clears VA Health Care Bill:   The Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs on Tuesday advanced legislation to expand access to health care and dental care at the Department of Veterans Affairs. “I am proud that we are making good progress in improving and expanding health care and other benefits for the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our country,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chairman.  A key bill in the package of legislation sent to the full Senate would expand access to the high-quality, cost-effective health care that the Department of Veterans Affairs now provides to approximately 6.5 million veterans each year. Currently, veterans above certain income levels and without serious service-connected disabilities are unable to receive care. Sanders’ measure would reaffirm the nation’s commitment to those veterans with the most severe service-connected disabilities and lowest incomes, while expanding access to veterans currently unable to enroll in three important ways.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Progressive Budget: A select group of House and Senate lawmakers are working on a budget compromise ahead of a December deadline, Vermont Public Radio reported. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the conference committee, last week submitted his own model outline for a progressive budget. Sanders will join VPR today at noon and 7 p.m. ET to discuss budget negotiations with hosts Jane Lindholm and Sage Van Wing.   Low Expectations: Rock-bottom expectations and typical Washington gridlock are creating a perception that even if Democrats and Republicans on the budget committee just give up, it's not actually their fault. Most members think expectations are right where they belong. “In a dysfunctional United States Congress, it's not possible to set expectations low enough," Sen. Sanders, who also serves on the negotiating panel, told Politico. “Expectations are low.”   Social Security: Sen. Sanders and others want to lift the cap on income that is taxed for Social Security, which currently stands at $113,700. Because of the growing "retirement crisis" in America, Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued in a Senate floor speech on Monday that “we should be talking about expanding Social Security benefits—not cutting them.” She noted that several senators, including Tom Harkin and Sanders have been pushing for just that, The Huffington Post and Mother Jones reported online.   Single-Payer Popular Around the World: Nations with single payer health care are more satisfied with their health systems than citizens in the United States, according to new polling cited by The Washington Post. Citizens in the United Kingdom were among the most satisfied of all the nations polled, while Americans ranked their system the lowest.  Continue reading here.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Budget Negotiations: As negotiators struggle to write a 2014 budget, Sen. Bernie Sanders laid out his own vision for what the government's priorities should be complete with big jumps in taxes and social spending and cuts at the Pentagon, The Washington Times reported. Rather than talking about cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Sanders said the federal government should ask wealthy individuals and major Wall Street companies to pony up to expand the social safety nets. Sanders is one of the 29 negotiators working to hammer out a budget.   USPS Revenue Up: The U.S. Postal Service recorded its first revenue increase in five years and mail volume showed signs of stabilizing despite continued decline - but the agency's annual $5.6 billion pre-funding requirement for future retirees continued to be a drag on postal finances, USPS and union officials said. Sen. Sanders, who has proposed legislation to end the obligation, said the Postal Service would have recorded a net profit of $600 million without it, The Washington Post reported on Monday. "In terms of their business operations, they brought in more than they spent, but they have this burden," Sanders said in an interview Friday. "No other business or government agency is burdened with this mandate."   Expand Preschool: Months after President Obama proposed expanding preschool to every 4-year-old in the country, members of Congress unveiled legislation last week that would make it happen. Sen. Tom Harkin’s bill was endorsed by 10 Democratic senators and Sen. Sanders, an independent, but no Republicans, according to The Washington Post.   State of the Union: Sen. Sanders is holding his fourth annual State of Union essay-writing contest for Vermont high school students. Sanders is asking students to write an essay of 250 to 500 words about their view of the state of the union as the president prepares for his State of the Union address to Congress in January. The deadline for submissions is noon on Jan. 10, 2014. Sanders will visit the winner's school to hold a student town meeting to discuss the state of the union and the future of the country. The finalists' essays will be entered in the Congressional Record and posted on Sanders' website, The Associated Press, WCAX-TV and WPTZ-TV reported on Monday.

Must Read: Growing Clamor About Inequities of Climate Crisis -Steven Lee Myers and Nicholas Kulish, The New York Times:   WARSAW — Following a devastating typhoon that killed thousands in the Philippines, a routine international climate change conference here turned into an emotional forum, with developing countries demanding compensation from the worst polluting countries for damage they say they are already suffering.  Calling the climate crisis “madness,” the Philippines representative vowed to fast for the duration of the talks. Malia Talakai, a negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, a group that includes her tiny South Pacific homeland, Nauru, said that without urgent action to stem rising sea levels, “some of our members won’t be around.”  From the time a scientific consensus emerged that human activity was changing the climate, it has been understood that the nations that contributed least to the problem would be hurt the most. Now, even as the possible consequences of climate change have surged — from the typhoons that have raked the Philippines and India this year to the droughts in Africa, to rising sea levels that threaten to submerge entire island nations — no consensus has emerged over how to rectify what many call “climate injustice.”  Growing demands to address the issue have become an emotionally charged flash point at negotiations here at the 19th conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which continues this week.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   An Affordable Care Act Success Story: Colleen O'Brien went to a clinic in White River Junction, Vt., and one of the so-called navigators helped her become the first person to walk through the doors and successfully enroll in a plan through the new online marketplace, a key provision of the Affordable Care Act. Despite all the problems, state and federal officials who support the law say that the long-term benefits of having access to better insurance will make up for the immediate frustrations with the website. “If some of the folks who are on these inadequate policies go to the exchange,  they may find that for the same amount of money, or perhaps a little bit more, they're going to find that they get a lot better coverage," Sen. Bernie Sanders said  in an interview  with the Valley News.   Hold Health Insurers Accountable: Democrats have been critical of the insurance industry, a motivating factor behind passing the Affordable Care Act in the first place. Sen. Dianne Feinstein last March introduced legislation to let the Department of Health and Human Services block “excessive” rate increases. Support for the bill could swell if lawmakers think industry executives have not done enough to keep premiums in check during the transition to the new government-backed insurance exchanges. So far, Feinstein’s bill has five cosponsors, including Sen. Sanders.   A Progressive Budget Blueprint: Republican lawmakers want to balance the federal budget on the backs of poor and middle class Americans, but Sen. Sanders has a better idea. Sanders introduced a 10-point progressive budget blueprint that outlines fair ways to raise revenue, reduce spending, and create jobs. The plan calls for closing offshore tax havens, establishing a financial transaction tax on Wall Street, ending tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, increasing the capital gains tax, repealing the remaining Bush tax cuts, and more,” Jim Javinsky reported at Truthout and on The Thom Hartmann Program.

A single-payer system, like Medicare, is the cure for America's ailing healthcare - Sen. Sanders, The Guardian: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/single-payer-cure-healthcare-reform
"We must not be content with an economic reality in which the middle class of this country continues to disappear.” - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) http://www.sanders.senate.gov/budget/
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Bernie for President?: Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Friday that it is essential to have someone in the 2016 presidential campaign willing to take on Wall Street, address the collapse of the middle class, tackle the spread of poverty and fiercely oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Addressing global warming also needs to be a top priority, not an afterthought, Sanders said. In an interview with the Burlington Free Press, Sanders said he is willing to consider a run, probably as an independent, if no other progressive candidate steps up.  USPS Profits: The U.S. Postal Service achieved its first revenue increase in five years but still lost $5 billion in fiscal 2013, according to figures released Friday. Postal unions, the USPS board of governors, and at least one lawmaker said the overall loss was due to a requirement that the agency pre-fund retiree benefits to the tune of about $5.6 billion per year. Sen. Sanders, who has proposed legislation to end the pre-funding obligation, told The Washington Post that the Postal Service would have recorded a net profit of $600 million without the annual payment, which the agency has defaulted on for the past several years. LINK  Budget Conference: Senate Budget Chairman Patty Murray and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan are in daily communication looking for ways to cobble together a deal, privately. With just weeks to go, however, members on the committee acknowledge a bipartisan coalition is meeting separately. Sen. Bernie Sanders remains "cautiously optimistic" something could be done if Republicans were willing to budge on taxes. “The truth is that the two sides are not that far apart,” he told U.S. News & World Report in an interview Thursday. LINK  Save Social Security: The conventional wisdom in Washington is that Social Security threatens to raise deficits and needs cutting, Sean McElwee wrote in The Huffington Post. Instead, McElwee says it needs to be expanded at a time when the middle class and poor need more help. "Social Security is not an entitlement program. It is an earned income benefit that has been enormously successful in cutting the rate of senior poverty," said Sen. Sanders.

The Week in Review:  Thousands of you have taken up Sen. Bernie Sanders’ invitation to answer a simple question on the income and wealth gap in the United States. Is it a moral issue? The response has been overwhelming. One of those who said yes was he Sid Meyer of Milford, Conn. “With declining wages I have to work two jobs just to stay afloat,” he told Sanders. What do you think?  Meanwhile, more than 700,000 Americans sent a message to budget negotiators in Congress: Don’t cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, they said in petitions delivered on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. On Friday, the Postal Service reported that it made a $600 million profit in the past year.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-111513

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama U-turn on Health Insurance: President Barack Obama reversed course Thursday and said millions of Americans should be allowed to renew individual coverage plans cancelled under the health care law. Sen. Bernie Sanders supported Obama’s attempt to keep his promise to consumers who wanted to retain their current insurance, the Valley News reported. But Sanders told Politico he remains concerned that many insurance plans do not provide sufficient coverage.  The Solution: “I get very tired of the carping of our Republican friends who have completely forever ignored the health care crisis in the country, 48 million uninsured, we as a nation are the only country in the industrialized world not to guarantee health care, 45,000 people die each year because they don’t get to a doctor on time and at the end of all that we end up spending almost twice as much as any other country for health care, which is why, by the way, I am a strong advocate of a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program,” Sen. Sanders told Chris Hayes on MSNBC.   Senate Democrats Tight Lipped: Senate Democrats met with administration officials Thursday in a closed-door caucus meeting to discuss the health care law and plans for moving forward. After the meeting, senators were tight-lipped. “Sen. Mark Begich practically sprinted from the meeting room to a nearby elevator. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp spoke at length to a reporter about an unrelated energy-regulation issue, but when Obamacare came up she professed an urgent need to get to the Senate floor,” according to National Review. “Give me a ring in the office on that one, ok?” the “normally loquacious” Sen. Sanders said.   Raise the Minimum Wage: Sen. Bernie Sanders is part of a move to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour. “We have a shot to do it because the American people are very clear about what they want," Sanders said Thursday on The Ed Schultz Show. Seventy-six percent of the American people want the minimum wage raised.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/111513

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders to Budget Conferees: Hands Off Social Security: Sen. Bernie Sanders told Reuters on Wednesday that a special panel of congressional budget negotiators was presented a petition signed by more than 700,000 Americans opposed to cuts in Social Security and other programs. Sanders has vowed to stop efforts to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits, Bloomberg Businessweek reported. Budget negotiators said on Wednesday that they were still far from an agreement and put off scheduling any other public meetings as talks to ease automatic spending cuts moved behind closed doors. “I'm not a great fan of background negotiations,” Sanders said.   Carbon Tax Would Lower Deficit, CBO Says: The Congressional Budget Office is out with new data showing that imposing a carbon tax would dramatically reduce the deficit, The Hill reported. The CBO report, issued Wednesday, lists options to cut the U.S. deficit along with their cost savings, according to National Journal. Both publications noted that Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer floated a bill with Sen. Sanders. Their Climate Protection Act would impose a $20 dollar-per-ton tax. It would devote some of the revenue for deficit reduction but would return three-fifths of the revenue to U.S. residents.   The Fed: The Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing today on the nomination of Janet Yellen to head the Federal Reserve. “The Fed is an enormously powerful … secretive agency and the more light we can shed on it would be a good thing for the American people," Sen. Sanders told the Los Angeles Times. A Sanders provision in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law called for an audit of actions taken by the Fed during the 2008 financial crisis. Sanders supports expanded Fed audits but he disagrees with Sen. Rand Paul's plan to delay a confirmation vote on Yellen in order to get a vote on the legislation. “The American people are getting tired of this kind of obstruction,” said Sanders.   Community Health Centers: A remote corner of Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom is getting a new health center to help Essex County residents obtain health services closer to home, the Caledonian Record reported. Sen. Sanders recently announced the grant that will support a satellite medical office in Canaan, Vt.  Meanwhile, Gifford Medical Center in Randolph, Vt., was awarded $812,500. Altogether, the number of federally qualified health centers in the state jumped from eight to 11. Sen. Sanders hailed the awards as “a huge step forward for health care in Vermont,” the Valley News reported on Thursday.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/111413

At a time when we are experiencing more wealth and income inequality than at any time since the 1920s, and when Wall Street and large corporations are enjoying record profits, we should be asking the very wealthiest people in this country to start paying their fair share of taxes.  See Sen. Sanders' blueprint for a progressive budget and sign the petition here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/budget/
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Health Care: Sen. Bernie Sanders says he’s frustrated by technical problems that have plagued the federal health exchange but he doesn’t want to make major alterations at this time. “What I think we need to do is take a look in the next several weeks to see the kind of progress that’s being made,” Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. “And if progress is not being made in a sufficient way we can address that.” Sanders said it’s important to remember that the Affordable Care Act already has had “some successes,” including letting people under 26 years old stay with their parents’ insurance plans and ending discrimination against women. LINK  Obama Nominates Market Regulator: President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that he will nominate Treasury Department official Timothy Massad to be chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulatory agency charged with policing financial markets that played a role in the 2008 financial crisis. Sen. Sanders said he would press Massad about the commission’s efforts to restrict speculation in commodities markets, Politico reported. “Will Mr. Massad make sure that the price of heating oil and gasoline is based on the fundamentals of supply and demand and not Wall Street greed?” Sanders asked, according to Bloomberg. LINK, LINK  Democrats Target Some Tax Loopholes: An internal document shows Democrats preparing to target tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations as part of congressional budget conference negotiations, but does not confront tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry, Common Dreams reported. Progressives like Sen. Sanders have called for an “end [to] tax breaks and subsidies for oil, gas and coal companies to reduce the deficit by more than $113 billion over the next 10 years,” but the document indicates that preserving these tax breaks continues to have widespread bipartisan support.

A Progressive Budget Blueprint:   Republicans in Washington want to balance the budget by slashing Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, education and other programs that millions of American families rely on. Sen. Sanders has a better idea. "At a time when we are experiencing more wealth and income inequality than at any time since the 1920s, and when Wall Street and large corporations are enjoying record profits, we should be asking the very wealthiest people in this country to start paying their fair share of taxes. That way, we will not only lower the deficit but bring in enough revenue to invest in our economy and create the millions of new jobs we desperately need," he said. Sanders is a member of the select House and Senate budget committee that meets again on Wednesday.  See the 10-point progressive budget: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/budget/
Watch Sen. Sanders talk about climate change: http://youtu.be/XSgF1cADK0Q
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Filipino Typhoon: The typhoon that struck the Philippines produced an outpouring of emotion on Monday at United Nations talks on a global climate treaty in Warsaw, where delegates were quick to suggest that a warming planet had turned the storm into a lethal monster. Scientists remain cautious about drawing links between climate change and any single storm, but say climate change is occurring. “The people who have studied this issue, the scientific community, feel a) that global warming is real and b) that it is caused by human activies and c) that it is already causing damage all over the world,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an interview Monday on MSNBC.   Veterans Day: “The Department of Veterans Affairs is slashing wait times for vets filing disability compensation claims, but more than 400,000 claims are still considered backlogged. “The improvement is not enough but we are making significant progress,” Sen. Sanders said on Monday on MSNBC. He called “clearly unacceptable” the long delays in processing claims for disability compensation. “As we honor our nation's veterans today, we must realize the important debt we owe them, a debt we can never truly repay,” Sen Sanders, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, wrote in The Caledonian-Record and The Hill.   Health Centers: Three new federally-supported community health centers will open in Vermont. Like eight centers already operating throughout the state, the new centers will offer primary care to both the insured and uninsured. Sen. Bernie Sanders says the new centers fit in with the goals of the Affordable Care Act. “The goal is to have them in every area in the state so that people can have good quality primary health care in their community, some place near where they live. “We are probably, per capita, doing better than any state in the nation in accessing community health centers,” Sanders told WPTZ-TV.  Minimum Wage: President Barack Obama on Friday threw his weight behind increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10. This is more than a dollar higher than what he proposed in his State of the Union address. Sen. Tom Harkin's plan would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 and tie the minimum wage to inflation. So far, 31 Democrats and Sen. Sanders have come out in support of his legislation, according to U.S. News & World Report.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders:  Veterans Day: “On this Veterans Day I want to express a special thanks to Vermont veterans. In war after war, from the Revolutionary War to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Vermont service members have been there when their country called. We are proud of their service,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, wrote in a column published Monday in the Rutland Herald, Times Argus, Bennington Banner, Brattleboro Reformer and Eagle Times.  Veterans Day: Sen. Sanders will be busy making the rounds today showing his gratitude. He wants to make sure veterans are taken care of and receive the benefits they and receive the taken care of and receive the benefits they deserve. “I am talking about the men and women who came home from war hurt in one way or another. Sometimes it’s losing an arm or a leg or eyesight or hearing. But other times the wounds are invisible,” Sanders said last week at a news conference in Washington with leaders of veterans’ service organizations. He will participate in events in St. Albans and Burlington, WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV reported.   Veterans Day: When visiting the grave of family member Maxine Loomis in Westminster, Barbara Titus was shocked to discover that a brass plaque that was affixed to the gravestone had been stolen. On Sunday a news plaque was delivered and almost 100 people filled the Putney Community Center to hear speakers talk about Veterans Day and listen to the American Legion Band. Sam Haskins, veteran policy advisor to Sen. Sanders, read a letter from the senator, the Brattleboro Reformer reported.  Make VA Shutdown Proof: Congress is considering legislation to make the Department of Veterans Affairs shutdown-proof because lawmakers want to insulate veterans benefits from the next budget deadlock. Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, told Gannett News Service that by the end of last month’s 16-day shutdown, the country was about a week away from being unable to send checks to disabled veterans and veterans on pensions. “We were worried that within the cemetery division, we were looking at the horrible situation where some burials would have to be delayed,” Sanders said. “And that’s clearly not acceptable.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/111113

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Massive Deaths in Wake of Philippines Typhoon: The super typhoon that tore through the Philippines caused unconfirmed estimates of at least 10,000 dead bore down on central Vietnam on Sunday, already ranking as one of Asia’s most damaging natural disasters in recent decades, The Washington Post reported.  Community Health Centers: Thousands of additional Vermonters are expected to receive more affordable health care this year thanks to $2.4 million in federal funds to designate three new federally-qualified health centers in Arlington, Bristol and Randolph. Sen. Bernie Sanders has championed such facilities and fought to secure the additional funding. “That means about 160,000 people are getting good quality health care at an affordable cost, dental care, mental health counseling and access to the lowest cost prescription drugs in America,” Sanders told WCAX-TV in a report broadcast Saturday and Sunday.   NSA is Out of Control: “It’s been called the 4th secret branch of government. Now, it’s about time to gather intel on the NSA—what are they doing, why they are doing it, who are they doing it to, etc. As Sen. Bernie Sanders has said, these folks got a lot of expensive toys at their disposable and they are out of control,” Jamala Rogers wrote in a column for The St. Louis American.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders for President?: He says there's a 1 percent chance he'll run in 2016 as a way to force the country's prospective leaders into a debate over the share of wealth going to America's top 1 percent. “I worry very much that those issues are not being discussed,” Sanders told WCAX-TV. "That is the most important domestic issue that we have got to talk about." Sanders cited a lack of jobs for young adults and a rising percentage of the country slipping into poverty, but said he'll only run if no one else is willing to champion those issues.  Food Labels: The Grocery Manufacturers Association is working with members of Congress on legislation to block state laws requiring the labeling of biotech ingredients. The federal legislation would leave it to the Food and Drug Administration to determine what appears on food labels, based on health, safety and nutrition concerns. The Senate soundly defeated two years in a row an amendment proposed by Sen. Sanders intended to smooth the way for states to impose biotech labeling requirements, Congressional Quarterly reported.   Jobs: Sen. Sanders said “real unemployment” in the U.S. in October was nearly 14 percent, according to Labor Department figures released on Friday that count those who gave up looking for jobs and those forced to settle for pat-time work. On The Thom Hartmann Program, Sanders once again called for Congress to create millions of jobs putting people to work rebuilding crumbling roads, bridges, water systems and other infrastructure projects.  Community Health Centers: Sen. Sanders said new community health centers to be opened with some of the $11 billion authorized by a provision he put into the Affordable Care Act will provide primary care for more than 1 million new patients. On The Thom Hartmann Program on Friday, Sanders welcomed the release earlier in the week of $150 million for 236 new centers across the country. He called health centers a “bright spot” in the U.S. health care system.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/110913
The Week in Review:   In a major expansion of affordable primary care in America, community health centers on Thursday were awarded federal funding to bring primary care to 1.25 million more patients. Real unemployment was 13.8 percent in October, the Labor Department announced on Friday. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been leading the fight in a special budget committee to focus on creating jobs instead of cutting Social Security and other programs that help working families. A new report released by the Census Bureau on Wednesday found that Social Security did more than anything else to keep retirees out of poverty. Another way Sanders wants to create jobs is to transition from fossil fuels to green energy sources. He helped launch a new research center on Monday in Vermont that will work on ways to bring down the cost of solar power.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Health Centers Expand: A new round of federal grants will support three more federally-funded health clinics in Vermont in addition to the eight already caring for one in five Vermonters. Sen. Bernie Sanders announced Thursday that the Battenkill Valley Health Center based in Arlington, Vt., the Five-Town Health Alliance based in Bristol, Vt., and clinics affiliated with Gifford Medical Center in Randolph, Vt., will receive the federal designation. Altogether, 163,000 Vermonters will now receive affordable primary medical, dental and mental health care and low-cost prescription drugs, according to the Bennington Banner, Rutland Herald, Vermont Public Radio and an Associated Press article carried by the Burlington Free Press, Times Argus, Valley News and others. “It is just a huge step forward for primary health care in the state of Vermont,” Sanders said.   Senate Approves Ban on Gay Bias at Work: The Senate passed legislation Thursday banning workplace discrimination against gay and transgender workers, nearly two decades after a push for such protection began in Congress. It would bar government agencies, labor unions and private employers with more than 15 employees from making decisions about hiring, firing, promotions or other matters based on a worker's sexual orientation or gender identity, which covers transgender workers. “I am very pleased that the Senate has taken this important step toward making America the democratic and inclusive society it should be,” Sen. Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press, The Associated Press and on WPTZ-TV.   Minimum Wage Push: Senate Democratic leadership is weighing when to consider a bill that would raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to as much as $10.10 per hour, Politico reported. Sen. Sanders said “there’s a desperate need to raise the minimum wage.”   Veterans Day: As Veterans Day approaches, Sen. Sanders joined top veterans organizations to discuss priorities for aiding the nation's veterans, McClatchy reported. “Bottom line here is that we owe a debt of gratitude to the veterans’ community that can never be repaid,” Sanders said. “But we have the moral obligation to do everything that we can to make those lives as good as they possibly can be, and that’s what Veterans Day 2013 means to me.” Support for veterans overcomes partisan differences, Sanders added. “Congress is dysfunctional but there will be a bipartisan agreement to defend our veterans,” Sanders said, according to Talk Radio News Service.

Community Health Centers Expand:   Sen. Bernie Sanders announced on Thursday that the federal government designated three new community health centers in Vermont. The announcement will increase from eight to 11 the number of health centers that will provide primary care for some 163,000 patients throughout the state. Nationwide, the latest round of grants awarded today totaled $150 million for 236 new community health centers around the country to serve more than 1.25 million additional patients.  A Sanders provision in the Affordable Care Act authorized $11 billion to build, expand, and operate community health centers throughout the United States.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Health Care: Sen. Bernie Sanders debated health care with Sen. David Vitter on CNN's Crossfire Wednesday. Sanders voted for the Affordable Care Act to provide insurance for 20 million more Americans, but he said he does not believe it goes far enough to address the nation's health care problems. “I believe that the United States should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care as a right for all people,” Sanders said.   Minimum Wage: Senate Democrats plan to discuss their legislative strategy for raising the minimum wage to over $10 an hour at a lunch meeting Thursday. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Tom Harkin is spearheading the push to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour but not all Democrats are yet on board. Thirty-one Democrats and Sen. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, have co-sponsored Harkin’s bill, The Hill reported.   Earned Benefits: Sen. Sanders and a coalition of liberal allies are lining up to oppose potential cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security through the budget conference committee, Congressional Quarterly reported. “On these issues, Congress is way out of touch. The American people do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,” Sen. Sanders said.   No Grand Bargain: The latest round of budget negotiations likely will not yield a so-called "grand bargain" that includes cuts to major entitlement programs, according to BuzzFeed. Liberal Democrats are opposing any changes to Social Security, which Republicans are demanding for a deal. “The issue is not a big deal or a little deal, the issue is what kind of deal makes sense to the American people,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders. “If you have a deal that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid that is a very bad deal. “  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/110713
Sens. Bernie Sanders and David Vitter hold different views on health care. Sanders supports a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system to provide better care for more people at less cost. Sanders also has been a champion of expanding community health centers in Vermont and across the country to provide affordable primary care, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs and mental health counseling. On Wednesday, the two senators debated health care on CNN’s Crossfire.  Watch the interview: http://youtu.be/2QeQ5mG5eK0
Poverty in America:   The nation's poverty rate was 16.0 percent in 2012, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released on Wednesday. The supplemental poverty measure takes into account the impact on family resources of different benefits and expenses. Social Security, for example, kept 26.6 million Americans out of poverty last year. Food stamps provided by the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program, or SNAP, kept another 5 million people above the poverty level, the report said. The main reason people fell into poverty last year was out-of-pocket health care expenses. That put 10.6 million people into poverty, the Census Bureau said.  Instead of working to cut poverty, some in Congress are considering cuts to the very programs that have kept people out of poverty.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the special committee working on a budget for the coming year, is leading the effort to fend off attacks on programs that help working families.   http://www.sanders.senate.gov/a-different-way-of-measuring-poverty

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):    Grotesque Inequality: The nation’s income gap continues to widen as Washington lawmakers consider cuts to vital programs that help middle-class Americans stay afloat. “What we need to do is focus on job creation, raising the minimum wage, changing our trade policy and paying attention to the middle class rather than the billionaires and multinational corporations,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC on Tuesday. Sanders called growing income inequality in the United States “grotesque.”    A ‘Remarkable Turnaround’ on Gay Rights: As Democrats and Republicans in support of ENDA rose to voice their support, senators opposed to the bill sat quietly, passing on opportunities to take the floor and speak out against the legislation. “It is really a remarkable turnaround," Sen. Sanders told U.S. News & World Report. "Republicans did not offer up anybody because they now see it as bad politics to oppose gay rights.”    Solar Research: A new federally funded solar research center located in Williston, Vt., was announced on Monday.  Sen. Sanders pushed for the U.S. Energy Department to locate the center in Vermont, NECN-TV reported.    VA’ ‘Image Problem’: Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, chided VA officials for not providing his committee with the agency’s views on pending legislation in a timely manner. He warned the VA that even if it didn’t want to engage, he and Congress would press on. “Our job is to legislate,” Sanders said, “and we’re going to go forward with or without the cooperation of the VA and the administration.” The point was among several cited by Politico in a report on the department’s failure to address its “image problem.”    Continue reading here:   http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/110613
Serious Evils:  “The most serious of the evils that afflict the world these days are youth unemployment and the loneliness of the old,” Pope Francis recently declared. “The old need care and companionship. The young need work and hope but have neither one nor the other,” the pontiff added in remarks cited on the Senate floor on Tuesday by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “I couldn't agree more,” the senator said. “We cannot turn our backs on the elderly. We cannot cut Social Security and Medicare. We cannot turn our backs on the young people.”  Continue reading here: http://youtu.be/ySPS9YtXeyc

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Solar Test Center: Sen. Bernie Sanders and Gov. Peter Shumlin announced a new federally funded solar site in Williston, Vt., on Monday, Vermont Public Radio, the Burlington Free Press and The Associated Press reported. Researchers will use the center to test new ways to reduce the cost of solar energy. Shumlin credited Sanders with pushing for the center in Vermont, saying the senator had been “like a dog on a bone to ensure we get the partners together to advance these efforts.”   Veterans Wait for Mental Health Care: Thousands of veterans seeking help for mental health problems are waiting longer to be seen by a counselor than the two weeks that is the government's goal, according to Department of Veterans Affairs data cited by USA Today.  “It is unacceptable that even after the hiring of 1,600 new mental health staff, certain VA facilities remain unable to ... treat veterans in a timely manner,” said Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate veterans’ committee.   Youth Unemployment: What's a bigger problem, youth unemployment or the fact that Social Security will be insolvent in 20 years? To Sen. Sanders, the answer is obvious, with unemployment rates in double digits for America's young people. “You have millions of kids out there who are never getting their feet on the ground in terms of a career…That is a crisis today,” he said in an interview with National Journal about his role as one of 22 senators on the House-Senate conference committee trying to hammer out an agreement on the federal budget.   Free Credit Scores: FICO, owner of the credit-scoring formula most widely used by U.S. lenders, is giving some consumers access to their credit scores for free, even before they apply for a loan. Bloomberg reported that Sen. Sanders introduced legislation in March that would provide consumers free access to credit scores that banks use to decide loans recipients and interest rates.

Legislation to ban workplace discrimination against gays was advanced Monday by the Senate. Sen. Bernie Sanders was in the 61 to 30 majority voting to take up a nationwide ban on workplace discrimination.  “I am very pleased that the Senate took a step closer to protecting gays from workplace discrimination. Vermont has prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation since 1992. It’s been illegal to discriminate against transgender Vermonters since 2007. In the U.S. Senate, it has been almost two decades since legislation was first introduced to enact strong and clear federal protections against workplace discrimination against gays throughout our country. Tonight’s vote is an important and long-overdue step in the right direction to make America the democratic and inclusive society it should be.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/workplace-bias-bill-clears-hurdle
Solar Power in Vermont:  Sen. Bernie Sanders was joined on Monday by Gov. Peter Shumlin and representatives of IBM, Sandia National Laboratories and the U.S. Department of Energy to launch the Vermont Photovoltaic Regional Test Center. The center located in Williston, Vt., will research ways to cut the cost of solar power and integrate solar energy into Vermont’s statewide smart grid. “We have a bold vision here in Vermont and across the country for an energy transformation phasing fossil fuels out as quickly as possible in favor of clean, renewable energy. Solar energy is a central part of that vision,” said Sanders, who serves on the Senate energy and environment committees.

Today's News  Health Care Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said Vermont could lead the nation toward a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system that provides better care for more people at less cost. The state in 2017 plans to implement a new universal health care system like every other major nation already has and like the one Barack Obama promised for the country when he campaigned for the White House in 2008, MSNBC reported. Sanders said health insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry oppose the move because they would lose their lucrative advantages under the current setup that wastes money on bureaucracy and paperwork.   Solar Power Lab A new center in Vermont will be researching ways to cut the cost of solar power and integrate solar energy into the state. The center, opening Monday, is one of five in the United States. The state entered into a partnership with Sandia National Laboratories and other institutions several years ago to conduct energy research. Representatives from Sandia, IBM, and the U.S. Department of Energy are joining Sen. Bernie Sanders and Gov. Peter Shumlin to launch the test center on Monday, The Associated Press reported.   Senate to Vote on Workplace Bias Against Gays A major test of how carefully Republicans can navigate the intraparty politics of sexuality will come on Monday, when the Senate holds a crucial vote on a bill to outlaw workplace discrimination against gay men, lesbians and transgender people with the bill apparently just one vote short of the threshold to prevent a filibuster, The New York Times reported.   Social Security “Social Security has been the most successful and reliable program in our history. For 78 years, Social Security has kept millions of senior citizens, widows and the disabled out of poverty. In good economic times and bad, Social Security has never failed to provide all benefits owed to all eligible Americans. Before Social Security, about half of our senior citizens lived in poverty. Today, while still too high, senior poverty is at 10 percent. More than 57 million Americans receive Social Security benefits,” Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a column published Sunday by thetowntalk.com in Alexandria, La.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/110413

Sen. Bernie Sanders discusses Vermont's move to single-payer health care with MSNBC's Richard Lui. http://youtu.be/kJASWF0IZ18
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Health Care: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said Vermont could lead the nation toward a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care system that provides better care for more people at less cost. The state in 2017 plans to implement a new universal health care system like every other major nation already has and like the one Barack Obama promised for the country when he campaigned for the White House in 2008, MSNBC reported. Sanders said health insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry oppose the move because they would lose their lucrative advantages under the current setup that wastes money on bureaucracy and paperwork.  Save Social Security: Sen. Sanders’ coalition to protect Social Security and Medicare has gathered nearly 500,000 petition signatures in a matter of days. “To put into context how successful this petition drive has been, it took months and a national television advertising campaign for Ted Cruz’s defund Obamacare petition to get to 2 million signatures,” Jason Easley wrote for Politicususa.  Save Social Security: Polls show that Democrats, Republicans and independents overwhelmingly do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, but people like the Koch brothers believe in a very different kind of America. They want Congress to end or drastically reduce government involvement in retirement programs (Social Security) and health care (Medicare and Medicaid) while also giving more tax breaks to the rich and large corporations, Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Sunday by the Burlington Free Press.   Save Social Security: Sen. Sanders of Vermont is leading the opposition to cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Sanders is working with many groups to try and find a way to balance the budget without taking away from working families and the poor. "At a time when the number of people living in poverty in our country is at an all-time high, we must not cut programs which provide basic security to tens of millions of our people who are struggling economically,” Sanders said in a Sunday morning report on WPTZ-TV.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Cuts Hit Nutrition Programs: In what Sen. Bernie Sanders called a "real blow to millions and millions of families," billions of dollars in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program took effect on Friday, CBS News reported. The typical family of four will lose about $35 a month in food stamps. “For some people it doesn't seem like a lot of money, let's go out to lunch, $35 for lunch. For other people it is a question of whether you adequately feed your kids. It's whether you have milk for your children, so $35 is a lot of money for families in need," Sanders said on WCAX-TV. Sanders said many families on food stamps include people who work full-time in minimum-wage jobs and still don’t make enough to buy groceries, according to WTOP-AM, the all-news station in Washington, D.C., WPTF-AM in Raleigh, N.C., and other CBS affiliates.   Budget Negotiations: Select House and Senate negotiators met this week to exchange ideas on the federal budget. Sen. Sanders, one of the conferees, told colleagues that the budget should focus primarily on lowering unemployment. "The most important issue on peoples' mind is not the deficit," Sanders told The Thom Hartmann Program on Friday. "What people are telling me is that jobs are the most important issue."   Save Social Security: President Obama has expressed worry about the long-term viability of entitlement programs. Liberals in Congress are watching that issue closely to stop proposals to cut benefits for the elderly and disabled. Sen. Sanders, who is a member of the new budget committee, said on The Wall Street Journal Report on KLIF-AM in Dallas that the president “is wrong on this issue and I hope he rethinks it.”   VA Budget: The Department of Veterans Affairs this week announced its opposition to a proposal which would protect veterans programs in the event of a government shutdown, The Hill reported. Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders supports the legislation and intends to mark up the bill in the coming weeks. "This is one pill that the VA is just going to have to swallow," said Alexander Nicholson, legislative director of the Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America.

The Week in Review:   Senate and House budget negotiators met for the first time on Wednesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the special panel, said jobs and the economy should be a top priority. He also insisted that there must be no cuts in benefits for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Social Security recipients are getting for a 1.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment next year, the government announced on Wednesday. Meanwhile, food stamp benefits were cut on Friday for millions of Americans. Sanders discussed those and other issues during his weekly radio and Internet appearance on The Thom Hartmann Program.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Food Stamp Cuts: More than 47 million Americans who receive food stamps will see their benefits cut starting Friday. Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz that the cuts will have a “horrendous impact” and send more people to already-overwhelmed volunteer food banks. A family of four receiving food stamps will get $36 less a month now that the program intended to help people during the recession has run out.  Jobs: The Food Stamps cuts will not only make it harder for millions of Americans to feed their families but dampen economic growth as well. “Our Republican friends talk about the dignity of work. Well, I agree with that. And that`s why in this country we need to create millions and millions of decent-paying jobs. Unfortunately … every one of those efforts to create jobs has been beaten back and filibustered by the Republicans,” Sen. Sanders told the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC.   Democrats Vent at White House on Health Website: Senate Democratic leaders summoned the White House chief of staff, Denis R. McDonough, on Thursday along with the official most responsible for the troubled health insurance website, Marilyn Tavenner, and the person entrusted to fix it, Jeffrey D. Zients, for a closed-door venting session. “They’re working hard. They recognize the problems. They’re putting a lot of resources into it,” Sen. Sanders told CNN afterward.   Dental Care for Veterans: “Our nation’s veterans should not be forced to rely on expensive private insurance, out-of-pocket funds or visits to the emergency room for their oral health needs,” Sen. Sanders said this week during a Veterans Affairs Committee hearing. As chairman, Sanders is making a strong case for expanding dental care for veterans beyond treatment of service-connected problems, the Army Times reported.

Feed the Hungry:  More than 47 million Americans who receive food stamps will see their benefits cut starting Friday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the “incomprehensible” cuts will “have a horrendous impact” and send more people to volunteer food banks that already are overwhelmed. A family of four receiving food stamps will get $36 less a month when the program intended to help people weather the recession runs out at midnight.  The cutoff comes as Senate and House negotiators are working to resolve differences in competing versions of a farm bill that funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. As the recession’s impact has lingered, 1 in 7 Americans are now on food stamps. The numbers have gone up as the economy has struggled to recover from the worst recession since the 1930s. Sanders was among 20 senators to sign a letter urging colleagues on to prevent “harmful cuts” and avoid putting up new barriers to participation in the program.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget Panel Begins Work: Congressional budget negotiators from both chambers met for the first time on Wednesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said jobs and the economy should be the group's top priorities, Time magazine reported online. The committee, Sanders added, should "not balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable people in this country—the elderly, the children, the sick, working families."  Hands Off Social Security: Sen. Sanders told lawmakers at Wednesday's budget meeting that cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid should be off the table, Congressional Quarterly and The Hill reported. He pointed out strong opposition to cuts and said the committee should "listen to the American people," WCAX-TV reported.  Don’t Cut Benefits: “At a time when almost all new income created is going to the top 1 percent and when the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider, we must not balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable people in our country: working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor. We must not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid,” Sen. Sanders wrote in USA Today.  Save Social Security: Sen. Sanders answered common questions about Social Security in a blog item on Talking Points Memo. “Social Security has been the most successful and reliable federal program in modern American history,” Sanders wrote. “For 78 years, Social Security has succeeded in keeping millions of senior citizens, widows, and the disabled out of poverty,” Sanders wrote in a column published Wednesday by The Caledonian-Record.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Budget Conference to Focus on Jobs: Democratic lawmakers will argue at budget conference negotiations for a jobs package that would include billions of dollars in new investment, setting up a contrast with Republicans as House and Senate conferees meet for the first time on Wednesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders is on the special panel that he said, in a column published in Tuesday’s Miami Herald, will try to “draft a federal budget that creates jobs, makes our country more productive, protects working families and lowers the deficit.”      Save Social Security: “Despite the fact that poll after poll shows that the American people overwhelmingly do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, very powerful big money interests and campaign contributors are pushing Congress and the president to do just that,” Sen. Sanders said in a column published in Wednesday’s Rutland Herald and Monday’s St. Albans Messenger. “As a member of a Senate and House committee that meets for the first time on Wednesday to begin work on a new long-term budget, my job is to represent the needs of ordinary Americans, not powerful special interests,” he concluded.  NSA Spying: The National Security Agency monitored telephone conversations of at least 35 world leaders as part of a sweeping surveillance dragnet that also tracked phone, email and Internet use by hundreds of millions of Americans. Sen. Sanders called the NSA "out of control" and told Public Radio International that the "massive distrust" the surveillance policies engender is having a negative impact on our relations with the international community, The Eagle in Addison County, Vt., reported.  CEO Pay: “It’s clearly time to rein in excessive CEO pay. But it’s also time to rein in their excessive political power,” Heather Gautney blogged for CNN online. Increased disclosure of political donations would be a “crucial” step, she says. Sen. Sanders has introduced a constitutional amendment to reverse a Supreme Court ruling that equated money with political speech.

Bernie Sanders said the panel should address what Americans consistently say is their top priority and devise a budget to promote jobs and the economy. The committee should lower deficits by closing tax loopholes, like the one that lets businesses and wealthy individuals stash money in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.  But the panel should not cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other benefits for working families. “At a time when less than 10 percent of the American people approve of the job that Congress is doing, I believe it’s time that we started to listen to what the American people want us to do,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  NSA is ‘Out of Control’: President Obama is poised to order the National Security Agency to stop eavesdropping on the leaders of American allies, administration and congressional officials said on Monday. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the spy agency “out of control” during a Monday interview with National Public Radio’s John Hockenberry. “How are we going to have the kind of cooperation that we need when there is massive mistrust of the United States for this type of spying?” Sanders asked in response to reports that the agency targeted the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and eavesdropped on other world leaders.  Dark Money: Sen. Ted Cruz is blocking Senate consideration of President Obama's choice to head the Federal Communications Commission until the nominee promises that the broadcast industry regulator won’t require more funding disclosures for political TV ads. "Ultimately, what they are about is creating a campaign finance system where billionaires can spend unlimited sums of money on campaigns and candidates, electing the people they want. That is not, in my view, a democracy. That is called oligarchy," Sen. Sanders told MSNBC's Ed Schultz on Monday. Raw Story and Politicususa blogged about the interview.  Older Americans: The Older Americans Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation that you probably never heard of or at least know very little about.  You know Meals on Wheels?  The OAA funds it, and also essential services for seniors like job training, caregiver support, transportation, preventive health services, and protection from abuse and financial exploitation. This Wednesday, Sen. Sanders will offer a 5-year reauthorization of the legislation to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. If the legislation is to pass the Senate and the House, it will need strong bipartisan support from the Committee, Greg Kaufmann blogged for The Nation.  Don’t Cut Social Security: President Obama proposed to cut Social Security in his 2014 budget, but “Senate Democratic leaders appointed Sanders to the conference committee, perhaps signaling their desire to hold the line against entitlement changes,” Congressional Quarterly said. The Huffington Post said Sanders has spoken out against Obama's offer to cut Social Security benefits as part of a compromise.

A single-payer system, like Medicare, is the cure for America's ailing healthcare - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), The Guardian:   I start my approach to healthcare from two very basic premises. First, healthcare must be recognized as a right, not a privilege. Every man, woman and child in our country should be able to access the healthcare they need regardless of their income. Second, we must create a national healthcare system that provides quality healthcare for all in the most cost-effective way possible.  Tragically, the United States is failing in both areas.  It is unconscionable that in one of the most advanced nations in the world, there are nearly 50 million people who lack health insurance and millions more who have burdensome co-payments and deductibles. In fact, some 45,000 Americans die each year because they do not get to a doctor when they should. In terms of life expectancy, infant mortality and other health outcomes, the United States lags behind almost every other advanced country.  Despite this unimpressive record, the US spends almost twice as much per person on healthcare as any other nation. As a result of an incredibly wasteful, bureaucratic, profit-making and complicated system, the US spends 17% of its gross domestic product – approximately $2.7tn annually– on healthcare. While insurance companies, drug companies, private hospitals and medical equipment suppliers make huge profits, Americans spend more and get less for their healthcare dollars.  What should the US be doing to improve this abysmal situation?  Continue reading here: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/single-payer-cure-healthcare-reform

Out of Control:   “The conclusion that most Americans have reached is that these guys are out of control,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Monday of the U.S. National Security Agency. The senator was commenting on continuing revelations that electronic spying tactics were used to track telephone conversations of some 35 foreign heads of state. Interviewed by NPR’s John Hockenberry for The Takeaway, Sanders worried about the fallout. “In an increasingly tight global community, where we have got to work together to combat terrorism, to do something about the serious problems facing the global economy, where we must address the planetary crisis of global warming — how are we going to have the kind of cooperation that we need, when there is massive mistrust against the United States for this type of spying?”  What do you think? http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/nsa-spying
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders at Center of Budget Battles: Sen. Bernie Sanders is optimistic that the lawmakers named to a committee responsible for crafting a fiscal 2014 budget agreement stand some chance of success. The Vermont independent, one of the negotiators on that conference committee, believes Americans’ low opinion of Congress — particularly of Republicans — will motivate the panel to address unemployment and mounting deficits in a way that’s fair to working families. “There is that pressure on everybody’s shoulders, regardless of your politics, and I hope that moves us in a fruitful direction,” he told the Burlington Free Press.  Sanders: Obama ‘Dead Wrong’ on Social Security: President Obama has offered to compromise with Republicans on changes to Social Security in hopes of corralling Republican support for his budget. "The president is dead wrong on this issue," Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Boston Globe. Sanders has been promoting a bill to raise Social Security withholding taxes significantly on those earning more than $250,000 a year, who currently do not pay Social Security taxes on the majority of their earnings. Sanders and his staff are fond of pointing out where they got the idea: Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.  The Right Way to Make a Budget: “It is time to develop a federal budget that is moral and makes good economic sense,” Sen. Sanders wrote in an op-ed published Monday by the Los Angeles Times. “It is time to develop a budget that invests in our future by creating jobs, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and expanding educational opportunities. It is time for those who have so much to help with deficit reduction. It is time that we listen to what the American people want.”  Sanders in the South: Sen. Sanders on his first Southern speaking tour posed a question that may seem simple but continually vexes and frustrates politicians, pundits, political scientists and columnists: "Why do white working-class people vote against their own interests?" he asked about 150 people at the annual meeting of the Progressive Network,” according to a Sunday column in The (Florence, S.C.) Morning News.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/102813

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Vermont Eyes Bigger Goal on Health Care: Vermont plans to launch the nation's first universal health care system, a sort of modified Medicare-for-all. It's an open question whether Vermont can work as a model for other states. "Developing a single-payer system for Vermont is a lot easier than in California or Texas or New York," said Sen. Bernie Sanders, using a term to describe a system in which health care is paid for by a single entity. He has been pushing for some form of socialized medicine since he was mayor of Burlington 30 years ago, according to The Associated Press.  Spying on Allies: In Washington on Saturday, demonstrators held up signs reading "Thank you, Edward Snowden!" as they rallied near the U.S. Capitol to demand that Congress investigate the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance of Americans and eavesdropping on allied heads of state. “It sends a terrible message throughout the world. We’re saying we don’t really trust you,” Sen. Sanders told WCAX-TV in an interview on Friday.  He also called for legislation to limit the NSA’s wholesale collection of data on Americans who are not suspected of any wrongdoing. He called the NSA “out of control” and urged the spy agency to “stop this nonsense.”  Budget Conference: Sen. Sanders is on the special budget conference committee that begins work this week on what could be a one-year plan to keep the government running when funding runs out in December. “I really don’t expect another government shutdown. I think Republicans have learned their lesson,” Sanders said on WCAX-TV.  Bernie for President?: “We need voices in the national campaign to speak about the needs of working people,” Sanders told WCAX-TV in the Friday night interview, but he quickly added that “there are other fine people out there” and said that “it’s very unlikely” he will mount a campaign for the White House. On Vermont Public Television, Vermont This Week host Stewart Ledbetter mentioned that there is talk, “as far-fetched as it may sound,” of Sanders running for president. Running as a Democrat, Ledbetter added, “seems anathema to the senator from Vermont.” Radio host Mark Johnson also was dubious but said Sanders, when pressed, “hasn’t closed the door on it.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/102713

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  NSA Spying: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France on Friday called for talks with the United States on new rules for their intelligence relationship after reports that the National Security Agency monitored Merkel’s cellphone and collected data about millions of French citizens. “We've got a real problem. I think we've got an agency that's a bit out of control,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on WCAX-TV. On The Thom Hartmann Program on Friday, Sanders said spying on allies undermines the fight against international terrorism. A Saturday rally on Capitol Hill was planned to protest NSA spying on U.S. allies and American citizens, WPTZ-TV said in a report that cited Sanders’ letter to President Barack Obama voicing his concerns.   Save Social Security: “Despite the fact that poll after poll shows that the American people overwhelmingly do not want to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, very powerful Big Money interests and campaign contributors are pushing Congress and President Obama to do just that … As a member of a Senate and House committee that meets for the first time on Wednesday to begin work on a new long-term budget, my job is to represent the needs of ordinary Americans, not powerful special interests,” Sanders wrote in a column published Saturday by the Brattleboro Reformer.  JP Morgan Mortgage Settlement: Regulators intend to announce another $4 billion settlement with JP Morgan Chase, The Wall Street Journal reported. The pact would end a lawsuit waged against the company for allegedly misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of mortgages sold ahead of the recession.

The Week in Review:   A special congressional committee prepared for the first hearing this coming Wednesday on a budget for the coming year. The White House, meanwhile, scrambled to fix the botched website developed to let people sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Overseas, the U.S. was in damage-control mode over reports that U.S. intelligence agencies spied on foreign leaders.  A “national embarrassment,” Sen. Bernie Sanders called it. He discussed these and other topics on Friday during Brunch with Bernie, his weekly radio, TV and Internet appearance on The Thom Hartmann Program.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Spying on Allies: European leaders united in anger at a summit overshadowed by reports of widespread U.S. spying on its allies — allegations German Chancellor Angela Merkel said had shattered trust in the Obama administration. Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote to President Barack Obama on Thursday about National Security Agency electronic surveillance of some of America's closest allies. “It’s outrageous,” Sen. Sanders told WDEV-AM’s Mark Johnson who first asked about reports that the NSA spied on heads of state in Brazil, Mexico, France and Germany. Sanders worried that such activities will harm the ability of the U.S. to gain its allies' full cooperation in combatting international terrorism, The Associated Press and WCAX-TV reported.  Obamacare: There was finger-pointing over the troubled HealthCare.gov site as a House committee on Thursday grilled contractors involved in developing the site. “Clearly the rollout has not been good,” Sen. Sanders told WDEV-AM, but he was confident that “at the end of the day the program will get its act together.” Sanders voted for the Affordable Care Act, but he said “it’s too complicated.” He prefers a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system.  Budget Conference: Congress’s budget conference committee will hold its first public hearing on Wednesday, beginning a six-week process that could frame Washington’s budget debate for the rest of the year. Sen. Bernie Sanders expressed hope that “some of the non-crazy Republicans” on the panel will listen to the overwhelming public sentiment for greater tax fairness and reasonable defense cuts without imperiling Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz. Sanders is one of 29 lawmakers on the committee, according to The (Rockland, Maine) Free Press.  Both Parties Seek Small Budget Deal: Republicans and Democrats will use budget talks that start next week to try to minimize or reorder broad spending cuts that began in March, with both sides Thursday playing down the possibility of a "grand bargain" that would address the nation's long-term fiscal problems. In de-emphasizing the likelihood of a larger deal, both parties appeared to be looking for limited areas of agreement in order to bypass the next round of the automatic spending cuts known as the sequester and buy time to deal with tax reform, entitlement cuts and other big-ticket items next year, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Spying on Friends:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday decried “outrageous” eavesdropping by the National Security Agency on some of the United States’ closest allies.   Sanders is cosponsoring legislation that would significantly rein in the sweeping surveillance activities of the NSA and other intelligence agencies.   In a letter to President Barack Obama, the senator also voiced concern that the U.S. actions could undermine cooperation in the fight against terrorism.  “The strained relations with our allies as a result of wholesale NSA eavesdropping have impacted our ability to work with these countries in combating terrorism and advancing common economic goals,” Sanders said. “Clearly, in the complex and difficult world we now find ourselves, it is imperative that we try to improve our relations with friendly countries, not exacerbate them.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/spying-on-friends

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget Conference: Members of a budget conference committee facing a Dec. 13 deadline are formally set to hold their first meeting next Wednesday. “It is imperative that this new budget helps us create the millions of jobs we desperately need and does not balance the budget on the backs of working people, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in The Capital Times.   Sanders in the South: Columbia, S.C., Birmingham and Atlanta may seem like odd locations for a self-identified socialist senator from Vermont who speaks in a native Brooklyn accent to hold town hall meetings. But Sanders is convinced that an unapologetically social-democratic political message—grounded in calls for economic justice and a redistributive state—can resonate anywhere in the country, even in those Southern states responsible for electing many of the Tea Party representatives in Congress, according to In These Times.

A Fair Budget:  A special budget panel was created as part of the deal to reopen the federal government for several months. Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke to Vermont Public Radio’s Bob Kinzel about the senator’s new position on the panel that “will put him right in the middle of a national debate over the proper level of federal spending and appropriate tax policies.” Sanders said it is important to reduce the deficit in a way that is fair to working families.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Budget Conference: Members of the newly empaneled budget conference committee are expected to hold their first public meeting next Wednesday. Ahead of the negotiations, Republicans have said they believe there is room to negotiate because Democrats want to undo or replace some or all of sequestration and the Republicans want curbs on entitlement programs. Sens. Bernard Sanders and Tom Harkin have argued in the past against the idea of cutting entitlements, Congressional Quarterly reported.  Older Americans: A Senate committee is scheduled to mark up legislation next week to reauthorize programs that provide services for seniors, but a key Republican has yet to endorse the proposal. The Older Americans Act reauthorization bill was introduced by Sen. Sanders with the top Democrat and Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as co-sponsors. Notably absent from that list is Richard Burr, the top Republican on Sanders’ subcommittee on aging, Congressional Quarterly reported.  Jobs: The government’s report on September employment came out Tuesday, delayed by the shutdown. “The furious debate over the budget did not concern our ongoing unemployment tragedy. The meme on the right is that millions are “takers” who won’t work. Yet three people are chasing every job opening. Corporations are sitting on record cash and profits, but they are not hiring at the rates of previous post-World War II recessions. The meme on the left…does it matter? America has little of a true elected left aside from Bernie Sanders,” Jon Talton blogged for The Seattle Times.  CEO Pay Rises, Breaks Records: For the first time ever, the 10 top-paid chief executives in the United States received more than $100 million in payment last year, according to a leading annual survey cited by The Guardian.

Shutdown Fallout:   An unsurprising 81 percent of Americans polled for The Washington Post and ABC News disapproved of the 16-day government shutdown this month, according to survey results published on Tuesday. Seventy-one percent said they  “strongly” disapproved.  Overwhelming majorities also say the shutdown damaged the U.S. economy, hurt the United States’ image in the world and the was bad for the morale of federal employees.

Today's news from Sen.

"I and others have got to do everything that we can to make sure that we do not see cuts in Social Security,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Salon.  Sanders Named to Budget Panel: Sen. Sanders was named to a conference committee designated to hash out differences between House and Senate-passed budgets. Sanders told Vermont Public Radio that one of his goals on the committee is to protect programs that are priorities for working families. “There are some good people on the conference committee,” syndicated radio host Nicole Sandler said on WWRL-AM in New York, N.Y.

Global Warming is a Greater Threat than Al Qaeda:  “You have the entire scientific community saying we have to be very aggressive in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Yet you’re seeing the heads of coal companies and oil companies willing to sacrifice the wellbeing of the entire planet for their short-term profits. And these folks are funding phony organizations to try to create doubt about the reality of global warming,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in an interview published in the November issue of Playboy magazine. “Big business is willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. I regard that as just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible. And because of their power over the political process, you hear a deafening silence in the U.S. Congress and in other bodies around the world about the severity of the problem. Global warming is a far more serious problem than al Qaeda.”  What do you think?

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Don't Cut Social Security: With eyes now turning toward a new budget committee, some liberals are worried about President Obama's proposal to cut Social Security. "The president is wrong on this issue, and I hope he rethinks it." Sen. Bernie Sanders, member of the new budget committee, told The Wall Street Journal and KPAM-AM in Portland, Ore. "The president is about to run into a major base problem if he tries to do this," said Rep. Keith Ellison, co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, referring to using the new formula, the chained consumer-price index, to determine benefits. "My advice to him is: Don't do it."  Sanders Calls Out Deficit Hypocrites: Sen. Sanders on Saturday offered a glimpse of how he might tackle the budget. "The hypocrisy is extraordinary. When it comes to Medicaid, we just can't afford to provide health insurance to our children [but] when it comes to going to a war that we never should have gotten into [in Iraq], no problem. These same deficit hypocrites … gave huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires," Sanders said at Penn Center on St. Helena Island, S.C., one of the earliest schools for freed slaves, and a favorite getaway for Martin Luther King during the Civil Rights movement, Corey Hutchins blogged.  Obama Calls in Computer Experts: The Obama administration said Sunday that it has enlisted additional computer experts from across the government and from private companies to help rewrite computer code and make other improvements to the online health insurance marketplace, which has been plagued by technical defects that have stymied many consumers since it opened nearly three weeks ago. This expanded team has come up with new ways of monitoring which parts of the federal Web site, HealthCare.gov, are having problems and has been taking the site offline for rigorous overnight tests, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman told The Washington Post.  Vermont Concert: Sen. Sanders is planning a special town meeting on Saturday featuring performances by 10 high school choruses from around the state. The event at Montpelier High School is designed to highlight the importance of funding for the arts in public schools. Student choruses will perform songs separately at the concert before joining together to sing "These Green Mountains," Vermont's state song, as a finale. The event is free and open to the public, The Associated Press reported. "Do you think he's going to sing?" a WCAX-TV anchor asked.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget Committee: Sen. Bernie Sanders was named to a committee to try and create a long-term budget plan by Dec. 13 and prevent another government shutdown. “It’s important to have Sen. Sanders on that committee to make certain they make the right choices going forward and we don’t end up in this mess all over again in January,” Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin told WPTZ-TV on Saturday. “I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to end the absurdity of sequestration and to develop a budget which works for all Americans,” Sanders said in a report posted byvtdigger.org.    Sanders in the South: Sen. Sanders' visit Saturday to St. Helena's Island resulted in something rare in the conservative Lowcountry: a self-described socialist receiving a standing ovation. Sanders told more than 150 people at the S.C. Progressive Network fall retreat that "white, working-class people in the South" have a tendency "to vote against themselves." The longest-serving independent in Congress visited South Carolina after stops in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi in an effort to unite progressives and working- and middle-class conservatives, The Beufort Gazette, The Associated Press and Raw Story reported.   Obama Wins Standoff with Congress: President Obama trounced the Republicans last week with a strategy of holding firm and winning an argument, not by finding common ground. Obama has proved better at the messy business of helping hold together his own party's congressional caucus than President Bill Clinton did. “For all the talk of Obama's distaste for schmoozing, he was the one who finally passed a health care law by holding together every single Senate Democrat, from Bernie Sanders on the left to Ben Nelson on the right,” according to The New York Times.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Named to Budget Conference Committee: The deal that ended the government shutdown set up a conference committee to reconcile budget issues between the House and Senate. Sen. Sanders is on the panel, WCAX-TV and The Nation reported. “There`s nobody else I`d rather have sitting across from Paul Ryan during this fight,” Ed Schultz said on MSNBC. “It gives Bernie Sanders a platform, not that Bernie has ever failed to find a platform on his own … but his voice will be heard on this committee,” Jon Margolis said on Vermont Public Television’s Vermont This Week. Writing for The Huffington Post, Jason Linkins said Sanders’ appointment ensures Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries will have “one strong, supportive voice in the room." Jason Easley at Politicususa said Sanders “has long been an outspoken critic of the Ryan budgets, and the Wisconsin Republican’s borderline obsession with privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare.”  Sanders Goes South: On a four-day swing through Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC that progressives in the South "are tired of being abandoned" by the national Democratic Party. "They believe, that with some help, they can start winning in these conservative states," Sanders said.   Sanders: Global Warming More Serious than al Qaeda: In a wide-ranging interview with Playboy magazine, Sen. Sanders says global warming poses "a far more serious problem than al Qaeda," The Hill, Politico, National Journal and The Daily Caller reported. "Big business is willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits," Sanders said.  White House ’16: Sen. Sanders' was asked about a potential 2016 presidential candidacy.

From the end of World War II until 1973, we saw an expanding middle class, with people’s incomes going up. Since that point, and especially since the Wall Street–driven financial crisis, you’ve seen a real collapse. Since 1999 median family income has gone down $5,000. Real unemployment, counting people who have given up looking for work or who are working part-time when they want to work full-time, is more than 14 percent.

The Week in Review:   The federal government reopened Thursday after Congress ended a 16-day government shutdown and averted a default on U.S. debts. President Barack Obama signed the measure in time for hundreds of thousands of furloughed workers to get back on the job. Republicans in Congress had hoped to use the fiscal crisis they created as leverage to undo the Affordable Care Act. It didn’t work. The agreement made virtually no concessions on the health care law. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he was glad that for now the “nightmare” was over, but he cautioned that continued spending cuts contained in the stopgap bill are “a disaster.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/the-week-in-review-101813

The two lawmakers will lead a budget conference committee tasked with reconciling differences between the Republican and Democratic spending plans. Sen. Sanders was appointed to the conference committee, ABC News, The Washington Post, Politico, Real Clear Politics and Bangor Daily News reported. Sen. Sanders said on WAMC-FM that any new budget negotiations must not include draconian cuts.  Democrats in the South: Southern Democrats are seizing on the widespread dissatisfaction with Republican lawmakers. Sen. Sanders is touring southern states this week. Ahead of an important Senate vote to reopen the government, Sanders video conferenced with a town-hall meeting in Jackson, Misss. "If you don't get involved in the conservative states, they'll never be battleground states in the future," Sanders told the audience, according to the Jackson Free Press.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Shutdown Ends :The federal government reopened Thursday after Congress ended a 16-day partial shutdown and averted a default on U.S. obligations. President Barack Obama signed the measure that made virtually no concessions on the health care law that was the reason Republicans started the fiscal crisis. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the resolution “a major political victory” but cautioned in a late-night interview on MSNBC that continued spending cuts contained in the stopgap bill are “a disaster.”  He said he was glad that for now the "nightmare" was over, The Associated Press, Burlington Free Press, Times Argus, Rutland Herald, Seven Days and The Washington Times reported.   Sanders Named to Budget Conference: Sen. Sanders was appointed to a conference committee to try to reconcile separate budget documents passed by the House and Senate this year. “I look forward to the negotiations that will take place,” Sanders said on MSNBC. “The time is long overdue that we stood up for the working families of this country, for the children and for the elderly and not move toward deficit reduction on the backs of the most vulnerable people," Sanders said in a floor speech on WCAX-TV.   The Agenda Ahead: The shutdown and the crisis atmosphere it created kept Congress from doing the work it should have been doing all along. “There are enormous issues facing this country. The middle class is disappearing. Poverty is at an all-time high. We're not even beginning to address the international crisis of global warming or our crumbling infrastructure or extremely high unemployment,” Sanders told Thomas Roberts in an interview earlier Wednesday on MSNBC.   The Next Fight: With the government re-opening and default averted, larger budget battles over entitlements and sequestration lie ahead. “When you have the Koch brothers, who sit on $71 billion, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process, trust me this battle has not ended,” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC’s Rev. Al Sharpton. “Our job is to bring the working people, the middle class of this country, together to stand up to the big money interests who want to repeal every major piece of legislation passed in the last 80 years to protect ordinary Americans.”  Tea Party Damaged America: Sen. Sanders said in a Senate floor speech Wednesday that Tea Party Republicans had severely damaged the country, The Hill reported online. The country has suffered a black eye in the world community, Sanders told the Vermont Press Bureau. “How can you proclaim to be the leading power in the world, the country that others are supposed to look up to, when you can’t even keep your government open and you can’t pay your bills?” Sanders asked.  “The United States’ position in the world has been severely damaged by this,” he added. On The Thom Hartmann Program, Sanders said House Speaker John Boehner could have prevented the crisis.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/101713

This Nightmare Will End: http://youtu.be/u_k1q42PjCg
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   House in Disarray, Senate Scrambles, Default Looms, Government Stays Shuttered, Sanders Says it’s ‘Frightening’: With the federal government on the brink of default, Senate leaders resumed talks on a deal to reopen the government and extend the Treasury Department’s debt limit. Senate leaders were blindsided Tuesday by news that House Republicans were moving forward on competing legislation, but that effort fizzled when Speaker John Boehner failed to pick up enough votes from right-wing Republicans. “The Republican House these guys cannot agree on anything so it is a bit of a frightening situation,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. Sanders doesn’t like it that the Senate compromise that was in the works would solve the problem for only a few months, but he told VPR, “I am willing to back off of that and say, 'Alright, we have to avert the crisis right now in front of us.’”   Sanders Sees a Way Out: “Let’s take a deep breath,” Sen. Sanders told CNN on Tuesday. "What I hope and expect happens is in the 12th hour, Boehner looks his right-wing extremists in the eye and says 'Look guys, I have gone as far as I can with you. I cannot allow a default to take place. I cannot allow this entire world's economy to go into recession. We're going to work with the Democrats. We're going to pass what the Senate has brought us.’ And that's the way out.”  Budget Conference: Whenever the dust settles on the debt and government shutdown crises, the House and Senate appear likely to embark on a new round of budget talks under the auspices of a now-rare bicameral conference committee. Sen. Sanders is on the Budget Committee and could be among the negotiators pushing for new tax money. “One out of four corporations in this country does not pay any federal income taxes,” Sanders told Roll Call. “Clearly, that’s an absurdity that has to be addressed and be part of that negotiation.”  Border Crossing Delays: Sen. Sanders hosted an August meeting with Vermont state officials and business interests to urge Customs and Border Protection management to address staff shortages that have resulted in long lines and frustrating delays entering the United States. “It’s from both an economic point of view and a security point of view not a good situation,” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.

The Way Out:   With the clock ticking, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that “the wild people” and “the extremists in the House of Representatives” were blocking every effort to restart the government and avoid default. There had been a sense of optimism Tuesday morning that Senate leaders were near agreement on a plan to reopen the federal government after a 15-day shutdown and extend the debt ceiling so the country could pay its bills. But by midday, the Senate negotiations were derailed. House Republicans had hatched a new budget that still faced opposition from the right-wing Tea Party fringe.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Leaders in Striking Distance of a Deal: Top Senate leaders said they were within striking distance of an agreement Monday to reopen the federal government and defuse a looming debt crisis just days before the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said leaders had made "tremendous progress" toward a deal and that he was hopeful Tuesday would be a "bright day." The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, seconded Mr. Reid's optimism. The White House postponed a planned afternoon meeting of congressional leaders with President Barack Obama, saying the schedule change would give Senate leaders time to hash out a deal. The latest proposal would reopen the government at current spending levels until Jan. 15 and extend the federal borrowing limit until early February, according to The Wall Street Journal.   Senate Nears Fiscal Deal: Sen. Bernie Sanders was optimistic on Monday as prospects for ending a two-week-old government shutdown and extending the nation’s debt limit seemed to take a positive turn, WCAX-TV reported. “I am pleased that, finally, the Senate Republican leadership understands that this crisis must be resolved.” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.  Sanders stressed that Senate Democrats already made a huge concession in agreeing to continue across-the-board spending cuts, he said in an MSNBC interview cited by The Washington Times.    Is a 1.5% COLA Too Generous?: With Social Security and veterans’ benefits expected to go up by only 1.5 percent in January, congressional Republicans and some Democrats would cut future benefits by changing how inflation is calculated. Sen. Sanders warned that adopting a so-called chained consumer price index would cut future benefits, WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV reported. He told WCAX-TV that he wouldn’t support cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid as part of any deal to reopen the government.The Senate veterans’ committee chairman said he finds it "incomprehensible that any serious person would believe that a 1.5 percent COLA is too generous,” Common Dreams and The Reno Dispatch reported.   The Next Citizens United: The Supreme Court is weighing a decision to throw out aggregate donor limits on individual campaign contributions, which would inevitably increase the amount of money from high-dollar donors flowing political candidates' campaigns, Amy Goodman wrote for Truthout.

An Attack on Seniors and Veterans:   With senior poverty in the United States significantly increasing, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday expressed deep concern that Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees may receive only a 1.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment next year. The estimate that the typical retiree is in line for only a $17 a month raise, one of the smallest increases ever, was made by The Associated Press. The projection comes at a time when congressional Republicans, led by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, have used the government shutdown as leverage to renew their push to cut benefits even more. The Republicans and some Democrats want to change how inflation is calculated by adopting a so-called chained consumer price index. The chained CPI also would lower benefits for disabled veterans and federal retirees.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/an-attack-on-seniors-and-veterans

Day 13:   With a partial government shutdown stretching into its 13th day and the looming potential for a historic default on government debts just days away, Senate leaders talked on Sunday but did not settle an impasse over a stopgap measure to reopen the government. The stalemate began Oct. 1 over House Republican demands to gut the Affordable Care Act. When that didn’t work, the House shifted course last week and tried to use the shutdown as an excuse to cut Social Security. (The Associated Press reported on Sunday that next year’s cost-of-living adjustment, even with no change in the law, will probably be only  1.5 percent, one of the lowest ever. It’s not certain because the workers who crunch the inflation numbers have been furloughed.) The budget negotiations on Sunday reportedly focused on  how long the government should be funded and for how long.  The Senate also took steps to reconsider a vote on Saturday when Republicans, voting in lockstep, blocked consideration of a resolution to let the government continue to pay its bills.  Sen. Bernie Sanders worried that a default would spike interest rates on home mortgages, car loans, student loans and credit cards, but he said on Saturday that he believes  Wall Street and big-money interests would not let “the crazies” force the country into a default that could send the economy into a tailspin.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate Republicans Block Debt Ceiling Extension: Senate Republicans on Saturday stopped a Democratic effort to avoid default by raising the government’s borrowing limit through next year. “The issue is pretty clear,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said afterward. “It is not a major ask to allow the United States government to continue functioning. It is not a major ask that the United States government pays its bills,” Sanders added on MSNBC.  Deadbeat Nation: “It's becoming increasingly possible that for the first time in the history of our country the United States will become a deadbeat nation, precipitating a national and international financial crisis,” Sen. Sanders said Saturday on WVNY-TV. "If a default occurs, it is likely that interest rates will spike for home mortgages, car loans, student loans and credit cards,” Sen. Sanders said on WPTZ-TV. “This must not be allowed to happen.”VIDEO, VIDEO   The House Crazies: Sen. Sanders said the government could reopen and the debt ceiling crisis could be averted if Wall Street puts pressure on House Speaker John Boehner. “The Republican Party remains very dependent on Wall Street and big money interests and I think those guys are going to go to John Boehner and say, ‘John, listen, you've got to deal with these crazies. You have to have a vote in which all members of the House can vote.’ And if he does that at the request of the big money guys, I think we're going to keep the government open and I think we're going to pay our debts,” Sanders said on MSNBC.

Dangerous Territory:   Senate Republicans on a party-line vote on Saturday blocked consideration of a measure to raise the federal debt ceiling. “I find it incredible that every Republican voted against a motion to even let the Senate consider legislation to pay our bills and prevent a default,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said afterward. “We are entering very dangerous territory.”  “It is becoming increasingly possible that for the first time in the history of our country the United States will become a deadbeat nation, precipitating a national and international financial crisis. If a default occurs, it is likely that interest rates will spike for home mortgages, car loans, student loans and credit cards. It is possible that the stock market will plunge, deeply impacting pension programs and household savings. This must not be allowed to happen.”  “The American people have been very clear in understanding that right-wing Tea Party Republicans should not be shutting down the government or threating not to pay our bills because of their hatred of the Affordable Care Act or wanting cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. That is wrong. A democratic government cannot function when a small faction choses to hold the American people hostage.”   Weigh in by taking the poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/debt-ceiling
Sanders Statement on the Fiscal Crisis: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-the-fiscal-crisis_------
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Watch Out, 1%: Republicans are pitching massive spending reductions, including cuts to Social Security, in ongoing negotiations over the government shutdown and debt ceiling. Sen. Bernie Sanders said reforms are needed to extend Social Security's long-term solvency. “The answer is, to my mind, you end the absurdity that somebody who is making $100 million a year pays into the system the same as someone making $113,000," Sanders told Mary Kissel in a Wall Street Journal video interview. “So if you’re in the top 1 percent, watch out,” she concluded.   Still No Deal: President Barack Obama on Friday began working aggressively with House and Senate Republicans to shape a deal to raise the debt ceiling and fully reopen the federal government, signaling a quickening pace in discussions to end a political stalemate that risks a U.S. debt crisis. The White House rejected a core part of a proposal from House Republican leaders that would extend the nation's borrowing authority for six weeks if the president committed to deficit-reduction negotiations. Instead, Mr. Obama signaled that he wants a deal that raises the debt ceiling for a longer period and creates a longer-term forum for budget talks, The Wall Street Journal reported.  Reid Pans Six-Week Deal: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has rejected the House Republican proposal for a six-week increase in the debt limit, The Hill reported. "We do not believe a six-week delay of a catastrophic default is enough time to give the economy the confidence it needs," Reid said on Friday.  2 States Plan 2-Tier System for Balloting: Barred by the Supreme Court from requiring proof of citizenship for federal elections, Arizona is complying — but setting up a separate registration system for local and state elections that will demand such proof.

Sanders Statement on the Fiscal Crisis: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-the-fiscal-crisis_------
The Week in Review:   The government shutdown dragged into a second week. A growing majority of Democrats and about 20 Republicans in the House favor a Senate-passed resolution to reopen the government, but Speaker John Boehner refused to bring the resolution up for a vote. When House Republicans first forced a shutdown on Oct. 1, they were demanding the defunding of Obamacare as part of any deal. That would be a death sentence for thousands of Americans without health insurance, Sen. Bernie Sanders told a Senate hearing on Thursday. As the week wore on, Republicans shifted their rationale for closing the government and defaulting on the country’s debts.  Now they demand deep cuts in Social Security and other programs. The whole spectacle drove public approval of Congress, especially Republicans and the Tea Party, to new lows. As Sanders sized up the situation in a Friday floor speech, he began by citing a piece in The Onion. “Psychiatrists Deeply Concerned for 5% of Americans Who Approve of Congress,” the headline said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Furloughed Workers Protest Shutdown: Hundreds of furloughed federal workers rallied in the rain on Thursday alongside the Congressional Progressive Caucus to ask House Republican leaders to allow a vote on a clean government funding bill that would end the government shutdown, Politico reported. Sen. Sanders said the current budget fight was not limited to disagreements over the Affordable Care Act, but a "huge ideological struggle for the future of America." Republicans, Sanders said, are using the shutdown to blackmail Democrats into agreeing to deep cuts to Social Security, Medicare and environmental programs.   Boehner's Offer 'Totally Unsatisfactory': House Speaker John Boehner Thursday evening offered a six-week extension of the debt ceiling in exchange for budget cut negotiations with President Barack Obama. “Totally unsatisfactory,” Sen. Sanders said of the offer which would leave the government closed. Democrats should insist on ending the government shutdown and on passage of a long-term extension of the debt limit, Sanders added in an MSNBC interview cited by Politico.  Reopen America: Instead of offering short-term deals in exchange for prospective cuts to Social Security and other entitlement programs, Sen. Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Republicans "should do what the American people overwhelmingly want them to do and that is reopen the government and pay our bills."  Holding the Nation Hostage: Vermont's congressional delegation remains firmly opposed to Republican efforts in Congress to hold the nation hostage with irrational demands, the Burlington Free Press reported. In an interview with Vermont Public Radio, the congressional delegation urged House Speaker Boehner to allow a vote on a clean funding bill to reopen the government. “This is enormously anti-democratic, and essentially what these guys are trying to do is annul the election in which they lost,” Sen. Sanders said.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/101113

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Yellen Nominated to Lead the Fed: President Obama on Wednesday nominated Janet Yellen to lead the Federal Reserve. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a frequent Fed critic, said his concerns about Yellen range from jobs to bank regulation, The Christian Science Monitor reported. “I want to know if she will act boldly and with a fierce sense of urgency to create the millions of jobs that this country desperately needs,” he said. “Is she prepared to stand up to the greed and recklessness on Wall Street? The Hill said Sanders has questions for Yellen on financial regulation.   Sanders Chairs Health Care Hearing: Sen. Sanders is hosting a forum today in Washington to highlight the impact that defunding the Affordable Care Act would have on millions of uninsured Americans. Sanders cites recent studies saying up to 45,000 people die each year because they do not have health insurance and don't have access to the care they need,” WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.  Debt Ceiling: “What’s happening is Wall Street and the big business community, the people who have huge influence over the GOP, are saying to Republicans that if you go forward and for the first time in the history of this country do not pay our debts, the United States economy — maybe the world economy — will be driven into dire straits,” Sanders said in a telephone interview Wednesday with the Vermont Press Bureau. He said he believes mainstream Republicans will seize control and prevent a default. But he remains concerned, he told Salon. “I am worried … [Y]ou really have people who live in another, in an ideological world which is very far removed from where I think most Americans are. And they believe so strongly, they hate Obama so much, and they believe so strongly in their views that if it means driving this country or the world into a recession or a depression, that from their point of view is a small price to pay to continue their efforts.”   Filibuster: Sen. Sanders favors a growing movement among Senate Democrats to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling for one year by changing Senate rules to prevent a filibuster. Such a move would allow the Democrats, with a 54-seat majority, to pass the bill with a simple majority instead of 60 votes. “This idea, which seemed far-fetched months ago, is gaining more support right now,” Sanders said. “I can tell you, without naming names, that the very highest level of the Democratic leadership are starting to support this,” Sanders told Vermont Press Bureau.

Remember Rep. Paul Ryan? The failed Republican candidate for vice president has been relatively quiet as Tea Party extremists have commandeered his party and the debate over the government shutdown. But the House Budget Committee chairman waded into the debt-limit debate in a column published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal. He said he would consider letting the government avoid default if “entitlement reform” is a part of the deal.  Translation: he wants to cut Social Security benefits and change Medicare.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Debt Ceiling Filibuster: Senate Republicans began to warn Tuesday that they would filibuster Democrats' plan to raise the U.S. debt limit later this week. The response, some senators said, should be to gut the filibuster. “If the Republicans are going to continue to obstruct and make it impossible to address the needs of the American people then I think we have to think about changing the rules,” Vermont's Bernie Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats, told Politico.   Supreme Court: The Supreme Court's conservative justices appeared ready Tuesday to free big individual donors to give more money to political candidates.  Sen. Sanders, who supports limits for campaign contributions, attended the argument in the court's latest major campaign finance case, according to The Associated Press and Congressional Quarterly. “If we do not want to move this nation to a form of society where a handful of billionaires can determine the outcome of these elections, then it is imperative not only we overturn Citizens United, but we put a lid on how much people can contribute in elections,” Sanders said in a speech outside the court that aired on C-SPAN and excerpted on Democracy Now. Interviewed on KPFK-FM in Los Angeles, Sanders worried that the court will further empower a few billionaires like those behind the Tea Party shutdown who are radically altering the American political landscape.   House Fixes Symptoms, Ignores Cause: House Republicans are preparing limited legislative fixes for symptoms of the government shutdown, including a bill to fund death benefits for the families of fallen warriors. As Republicans rush to fund necessary areas piecemeal, Sen. Sanders called on the House to treat the root cause of the problems. "Every time there is a story on television or in the newspapers about the horrors of the government shutdown, our friends in the House are passing legislation to try to address it. But the reality is we have 2 million people who are not being paid. Hundreds of thousands who are not at work. Tens of millions of people who do not make the headlines," Sanders said Tuesday on MSNBC.   Shinseki Warns Shutdown is Harming Veterans: Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki is warning that the government shutdown has harmed efforts to reduce the disability claims backlog and threatens to halt compensation payments for millions of veterans. “The momentum achieved over the past six months has now stalled with the government shutdown,” Shinseki said in prepared testimony he is scheduled to deliver Wednesday before the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. A copy of his testimony was obtained by The Washington Post. Shinseki will testify that if the shutdown continues into late October, compensation payments to more than 3.8 million veterans will not be made in November. “These include thousands of veterans who have the most severe disabilities,” he said in his advance testimony. Pension payments will also stop for almost 315,000 low-income veterans, Shinseki said.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/100913

Bernie Sanders sat in on the oral arguments in McCutcheon vs. FEC, the case that the court could use to further erode campaign finance laws and extend its controversial 2010 Citizens United ruling which opened the floodgates on campaign spending by corporations and wealthy individuals. “Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government,” Sanders told a rally outside the Supreme Court after the one-hour oral argument.

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Koch Brothers Finance Tea Party Agenda: The Koch brothers and other billionaires are financing expensive campaigns to promote the Tea Party agenda starting with defunding President Barack Obama's health care law, Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Thomas Roberts on Monday. "Obamacare is just the tip of the iceberg," Sanders added. He said the extreme right wing also wants massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.   A Planned Shutdown: Sen. Sanders criticized House Republicans Monday for causing a government shutdown that was “planned by the Koch brothers and other very wealthy people from the day after Obama was re-elected,” WPTZ-TV reported. “Can you imagine, Mr. President, billionaires, billionaires going to war against working people so that they and their kids cannot get health insurance? I mean I thing that is just obscene,” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech on WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV.   How the Shutdown Could End: Sen. Sanders said the government will reopen when the Republicans understand that they may lose the House of Representatives because the overwhelming majority of Americans, while disagreeing on Obamacare, nevertheless believe that it should not have been used to precipitate a government shutdown or to create a crisis over whether the United States defaults on its debts. “At the end of the day when they see that it will be politically dangerous for them to continue along this path they will change their tune,” Sanders told America Tonight anchor Joey Chen on Al Jazeera America.   Americans are Angry: “They are hurting. The average person in this country lives paycheck to paycheck and they look here at Capitol Hill and they see that instead of creating jobs we’re sending people home without pay,” Sanders said. “The way you deal with it is to say, ‘Excuse me. We’re going to remove you from office. You’re going to be defeated politically, and we’re going to have some sensible people in to replace you.’ That would be my hope and that’s my expectation,” Sanders added in the Al Jazeera America interview.

Day Seven:  As the government shutdown headed into a second week with no resolution in sight, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday made three key points.  First, Democrats already made significant concessions in the budget talks by agreeing to lower spending levels. The Senate went along with a House budget that would continue across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. That was a “major concession,” Sanders said, but House Republicans keep adding new demands.  Second, the senator doubted House Speaker John Boehner’s claim that the Senate-passed spending resolution wouldn’t pass the House. In fact, some 20 House Republicans have signaled that they would support a so-called clean resolution and vote with House Democrats to reopen the government “Bring it to a vote, let's find out what's happening,” Sanders told Thomas Roberts on MSNBC.  Third, the shutdown strategy was planned and paid for by the Koch brothers and other wealthy individuals who want to defund the Affordable Care Act, cut Social Security benefits, end Medicare as we know it, abolish the minimum wage and cut other programs that help working families. Their attitude, Sanders said, is “to use every ounce of leverage, even if it means catastrophic pain for America and the world, so long as we get our way.” He cited a Sunday New York Times expose that detailed how the Koch brothers and others plotted the shutdown “from the day after Obama was re-elected.”  The Koch Brothers: http://youtu.be/fNj8bpY2PEY

A Political Crisis:   Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers with the second biggest fortune in America, are threating to bankroll primary campaigns by Tea Party extremists challenging Republicans in Congress who don’t go along with their crusade to undo the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Saturday during a 90-minute presentation at The New Yorker Festival.  Then on Sunday The New York Times published a report detailing how the Kochs and others bankrolled a coalition of conservative activists pushing to repeal  the health care law and threatening Republicans who won’t go along with closing the government to try to get their way.  It’s “a political crisis,” Sanders said of the shutdown. It is part of a Koch-funded campaign to annul the law that passed Congress four years ago and was upheld by the Supreme Court and was a key issue in the 2012 presidential campaign that President Obama won by 5 million votes. And it is about more than trying to unwind what the American people decided through the democratic process, Sanders stressed.Their agenda is to end Social Security and Medicare, abolish the minimum wage, destroy the EPA and undo every other program enacted in the past half century to protect working families in America, Sanders added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Furloughed Pentagon Civilians Ordered Back: The Pentagon announced Saturday that it would order almost all of its 350,000 furloughed civilian employees back to work this week, a surprise move that could substantially reduce the impact of the government shutdown. The move takes a big bite out of the impact of the political impasse in Washington that has left the government without a budget. The decision was announcedSaturday by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, The Associated Press reported.  Veterans: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to ensure that VA disability compensation checks and other earned benefits continue throughout any government shutdown. In a column for The Hill, Gary Augustine, executive director of legislation for the Disabled American Veterans, said the bill “need[s] to be brought up for [an] immediate vote, passed and signed into law.”  Republicans Plot Next Move: House Republicans are discussing a range of demands on fiscal issues they would seek as part of a broad budget agreement aimed at ending the standoff with Democrats and the White House, including cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security and a firm commitment to overhaul tax policy, according to lawmakers who have participated in Republican strategy sessions,Congressional Quarterly reported.  The Obamacare Putsch: Shortly after President Obama started his second term, a loose-knit coalition of conservative activists led by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III developed a little-noticed “blueprint to defunding Obamacare,” signed by more than three dozen conservative groups. The New York Times said the plan articulated a take-no-prisoners legislative strategy to derail the health care overhaul if conservative lawmakers were willing to push fellow Republicans into cutting off financing for the entire federal government.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Democrats Already Compromised on Budget: The Senate-passed funding resolution to run the government represents a major compromise by Democrats who accepted more across-the-board cuts known as sequestration in order to avoid a costly government shutdown. "The continuing resolution, the $968 billion we passed, is much, much lower than it should have been," Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC. "We did that in order to get [House Speaker John] Boehner to agree to avoid a shutdown."  Furloughed Workers Want Shutdown to End: Federal workers rallied outside of the Capitol on Friday to demand an end to the shutdown that has furloughed federal workers. Sen. Sanders spoke at the rally, MSNBC, WCAX-TV and Politico reported. Sanders told the crowd that the House would vote for a bill to reopen the government if only the speaker would allow a vote. "If Mr. Boehner brought that bill to the floor it would pass tomorrow. That's what he has got to do. Let's put our people back to work. Let democracy rule,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV and New England Cable News.   Vermont Senators Back Guard Pay: Sen. Sanders wrote to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel expressing support for National Guard and reserve members to be treated like other military personnel and continue receiving pay during the shutdown, Roll Call, WFFF-TV and WVNY-TV reported.  Sanders Backs Veterans Benefits: Democrats have gone along with a few carve-outs to the shutdown, most notably agreeing to pay military salaries, but for the most part they have refused to entertain bills to open war memorials, fund the NIH, fund the veterans department and take other steps to reopen specific federal functions. Sen. Sanders has argued in favor of a bill funding veterans’ programs, but other Democrats say they must stand unified against what they have called GOP "gimmicks," The Washington Post reported.

The Week in Review:   The first government shutdown in nearly two decades began on Tuesday. A new budget year started without legislation in place to fund operations for most of the government. House Republicans refused to pass even a stopgap measure to avert a shutdown unless it also defunded or delayed the Affordable Care Act.  Sen. Bernie Sanders called that “blackmail.” Despite the House effort to undo the health care law, millions of Americans on Tuesday began the process of signing up for health insurance, he told Thom Hartmann during the senator’s weekly radio, television and Internet program on Friday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Playing with Fire: House Speaker John Boehner told Republican lawmakers anxious about fallout from the government shutdown that he would not allow a potentially more crippling federal default. Boehner’s plan to use a combination of Republican and Democratic votes to raise the debt limit appeared aimed at reassuring colleagues that he would not let the economic crisis spiral further out of control.  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday voiced concern that Tea Party Republicans were “playing with absolute fire” and were prepared to let the United States become “a deadbeat nation.”   Car Chase at Capitol Has Fatal End: Federal law enforcement officers killed a woman who resisted arrest while attempting to drive through security barriers near the White House and the Capitol. Capitol Police and the Secret Service lauded their officers for "acting heroically," as D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier put it. Sen. Sanders also praised the Capitol Police. “These guys are very well trained and they do a good job,” Sanders said on MSNBC. "As soon as the shots were fired, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was heading back the other way, and so we both took cover behind an SUV," Sen. Roger Wicker told WTVA-TV in Tupelo, Miss.   A National Disgrace: Sen. Bernard Sanders told ABC News that it is "a national disgrace" that the Capitol Police are not being paid during the shutdown, The Washington Post reported. He told Chris Hayes on MSNBC that the police are “putting their lives on the line every day” but that they are among more than a million federal workers doing their jobs during the government shutdown without knowing if they’re going to get paid or when they might get paid.    VA Painkillers: The death rate from overdoses of addictive painkillers at Veterans Affairs hospitals is twice the national average, but the VA continues to prescribe increasing amounts of narcotic painkillers to many patients.

Playing with Fire:   Three days into a government shutdown, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Thursday that House Speaker John Boehner could break the impasse by letting the House vote on a Senate-passed resolution to fund the government.  Enough Republicans, weary of their own Tea Party fringe, would join Democrats and pass the bill. But Boehner so far has stood with  the far-right group that forced the government shutdown in the first place over a crusade to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Sanders voiced concern that the same tactics by the same small band of extremists could have more dire consequences if the nation’s debt ceiling isn’t raised by mid-October. (The debt ceiling is the amount the government may borrow to pay its bills.) Unless the ceiling is raised, the United States, for the first time in history, could default on its obligations and become “a deadbeat nation,” Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz. “These guys,” the senator warned, “are playing with absolute fire.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/playing-with-fire

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   No Movement in Shutdown Standoff: President Obama and congressional leaders met Wednesday for the first time since the federal government shut down but emerged more than an hour later with no evidence of progress toward resolving their impasse over health care and government spending, The Wall Street Journal reported.   Sanders Supports Workers: Sen. Bernie Sanders is cosponsoring a bill to make sure furloughed federal workers get paid retroactively. That's what happened following federal shutdowns in 1995 and ’96, WCAX-TV reported. The Vermont Labor Department had received 84 requests as of Wednesday from federal workers seeking unemployment benefits. If Sanders’ bill passes, any unemployment benefits would have to be returned, the Burlington Free Press reported.   Shutdown: In back-to-back speeches on the Senate floor, Sen. Patrick Leahy decried the Republicans’ “bumper-sticker politics,” while Sen. Sanders said “what this debate is about is blackmail and hostage taking," Seven Days reported. Sanders said caving in to Republican demands would embolden them to attempt similar tactics on other issues. “If we surrender right now to these guys on this issue, they will be back,” Raw Story reported.   Enormous Issues Ignored: Congress needs to concentrate on the reason people elected them, Sen. Sanders told WPTZ-TV on Wednesday. “Right now what the American people are asking us to do is to address the enormous amount of problems facing working families in this country. Unemployment is too high. Wages are too low. People can’t afford to send their kids to college. We have an infrastructure that’s falling apart.  We have to deal with energy efficiency. We have to deal with global warming. Enormous issues are out there.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/100313

Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   No End in Sight to Government Shutdown: Lawmakers and the White House dug in Tuesday for a long fight as the first federal government shutdown in nearly two decades showed no signs of breaking. The closure, triggered by a congressional fight over President Obama’s health care law, means 800,000 federal workers were off the job on Tuesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said shutdown effects ranged from cancer patients not getting care they need to FBI agents are not reporting to work. Seventeen out of 30 staffers who work for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders are off the job today, the Burlington Free Press reported.   No Surrender, Sanders Says: The process of closing down large parts of the U.S. government was under way on Tuesday after frantic rounds of late-night political sparring failed to avert the first federal shutdown in nearly two decades. Democrats in Congress hold Republicans to blame for using underhand methods to overturn a health care law passed by Congress, upheld by the Supreme Court and endorsed by voters at the last presidential election. “If we surrender to hostage-taking tonight,” Sen. Sanders said in The Guardian, “these guys would be back within a couple of weeks without a shadow of a doubt. What we are dealing with tonight is an extraordinary anti-democratic act.”   Hostage Crisis: “People may disagree about the Affordable Care Act, but it is wrong for right-wing Republicans to ignore the results of the last election and hold the American people hostage by threatening to shut down the government unless they get their way,” Sen. Sanders said in the St. Albans Messenger.   Closure Impact: Sen. Sanders said the government closure could be “devastating.” In Vermont, passport offices like one in St. Albans could close, people applying for federally-backed mortgages will face delays, programs to help small businesses and Head Start might shut down, and people applying for Social Security, Medicare and veterans’ benefits will face a significantly slower process, the Bennington Banner reported. The same article said Gov. Peter Shumlin expects only minor disruptions.   Americans are ‘Disgusted’: In an interview with WPTZ-TV, Sanders said “people are angry, they're upset and they're frustrated. They have every reason to be. What people want is for Congress to address the issues that are facing the American people and that's creating jobs and raising the minimum wage, dealing with the affordability of college and they're disgusted by what they're seeing.” Sen. Sanders told WCAX-TV that House Republicans are “holding the American people hostage.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/100213

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Shutdown Begins: The first government shutdown in nearly two decades began at midnight after last-minute moves in Congress failed to break a bitter budget standoff over President Obama’s health care law. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the House attempt to undo Obamacare by closing the government “a precedent for blackmail that we cannot allow,” Vermont Public Radio reported. During an eleventh-hour interview on MSNBC, Sanders said Americans are “profoundly disgusted” because “a handful of right-wing extremists are trying to annul, do away with, the election results of a year ago. They haven’t quite caught on that Obama won.”   Devastating Impact: Sen. Sanders said the government closure could be “devastating” to Vermont and America. He said passport offices like one in St. Albans could close. People applying for federally-backed mortgages will face delays. Programs to help small businesses and Head Start might eventually shut down, WVNY-TV and WFFF-TV reported. “People who are to be applying for Social Security … Medicare …veterans’ benefits are going to have that process significantly slowed down,” Sanders added on WPTZ-TV.   Sanders: Shield Veterans: Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, introduced legislation Monday evening that would continue Department of Veterans Affairs funding for benefits and pensions even in the event of a protracted shutdown, The Washington Post and Military Times reported. Veterans also could experience significant delays when applying for new disability, education, pay and pension benefits, Sanders said in the Valley News.   Health Insurance Markets Open: Millions of Americans on Tuesday will begin shopping on the insurance marketplaces at the heart of President Obama's health care reforms. Sen. Sanders supported the Affordable Care Act but said the long-term solution to America's health care crisis is a single-payer national health care program. “The good news is that, in fact, a large scale single-payer system already exists in the United States and its enrollees love it. It is called Medicare … [and it] should be expanded to cover all Americans,” Sanders wrote in a column on The Huffington Post.

Shutdown:   As a midnight deadline passed, the U.S. government ran out of funds to keep much of the government running. The House on Monday repeatedly refused to vote on a Senate-passed bill to avoid a shutdown. Sen. Bernie Sanders decried the House push to use the shutdown as a lever – blackmail he called it –to try to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act.  Late in the night, President Barack Obama signed last-minute legislation to ensure that members of the military and personnel at the Department of Homeland Security get paid even during a shutdown.  Earlier Monday night, Sanders, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, introduced legislation to ensure that benefits and pensions aren’t cut during a protracted shutdown.

Blackmail:   As the federal government hurtled toward a partial shutdown at midnight, Sen. Bernie Sanders said it would be devastating for thousands of federal employees in Vermont. “This is going to hit Vermont hard and it's going to hit America hard,” Sanders said in a Monday afternoon floor speech. “If a shutdown continues, it would be devastating for families who have kids in Head Start. If a shutdown continues, it would be devastating for seniors who are on the Meals on Wheels program,” he added. The impasse continued because House Republicans insisted on defunding or delaying Obamacare as part of any deal to avert a shutdown. Sanders welcomed a debate over health care, but blasted the tactics of right-wing Republicans in the House using a government shutdown to try to get their way. “What this debate is about is blackmail and hostage-taking,” he said, “and that is unacceptable.”  Watch the speech here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_DSPSFXKxs&feature=share&list=UUD_DaKNac0Ta-2PeHuoQ1uA

 Take the poll here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/poll
Today’s news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Government Heads Toward Shutdown: The nation braced for a partial shutdown of the federal government, as time for Congress to pass a budget before a Monday midnight deadline grew perilously short and lawmakers gave no signs Sunday they were moving toward a resolution. Leaders of both parties said they wanted to avoid the first federal closure since 1996, but their public appearances seemed aimed more at affixing blame for the impasse, The Wall Street Journal reported.   Shutdown Nears: The U.S. government appeared on Sunday to be on the verge of shutting down for the first time in nearly two decades as House leaders were running out of time and options to keep it open. University of Maryland political scientist Roy Meyers suggested Republican leadership probably doesn’t want to relive the last government shutdown when Republicans were blamed more than President Clinton for the shutdowns. Thirty-six senators, including then-Rep. Bernie Sanders, experienced the 1995-96 shutdowns compared to just 20 percent of House members. “I would be surprised if any of them would want to repeat the experience,” Meyers told The Hill.   Low-Wage Workers: Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy are among 15 senators who signed a letter to President Obama calling for workers in companies that get federal contracts to be paid at least $10.10 per hour. They urged the president to issue an executive order that would essentially set a minimum wage for federal contractors, WPTZ-TV reported on Monday.   Health Care: Obama administration officials scrambled to get insurance marketplaces open on Tuesday. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act is expected to proceed even if the government partially shuts down. Sen. Sanders called the new law a welcome but small step. A single-payer system, like Medicare, is a fairer and more efficient way to give all Americans health care, Sanders wrote in a column for The Guardian.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/093013
At the Brink:   The U.S. government neared its first shutdown in 17 years after House Republicans early Sunday demanded a delay in implementing a new health care law as a condition for avoiding a shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared the House bill dead even before the post-midnight votes to delay President Obama’s health care law and repeal a tax to pay for it. Senate Democrats on Monday plan to table the Republican measures. That would give the House one last chance to pass a stand-alone spending bill to keep the government running when a new fiscal year begins on Tuesday. “The question is whether right-wing Republicans are prepared to highjack the American people and shut down the government,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on MSNBC.  Watch Sen. Sanders on MSNBC: http://youtu.be/83zaspylqgM  What do you think?: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/poll

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate Passes Bill to Avert Shutdown: The Senate voted 54-44 Friday to approve a bill that would fund the federal government and avert a partial shutdown. The legislation now returns to the House of Representatives. Sen. Bernie Sanders said Republicans are wrong to threaten a partial government shutdown "because they can't get their way," WCAX-TV, WPTZ-TV, The Associated Press and Burlington Free Press reported. Sanders said on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal and in The Wall Street Journal that a shutdown would damage the nation's credibility around the world.     GOP Blackmail: In a Senate floor speech on Friday, Sen. Sanders condemned “right-wing extremists” in the House who would “make us look like fools” by pushing the United States into to a damaging government shutdown, National Public Radio, The Raw Story and Mediaite reported. House Republicans showed “contempt for the democratic process,” Sanders told Mara Schiavocampo on MSNBC. "Republicans are saying 'You don't give us what we want, even though we don't have the White House, we don't have the Senate, we're going to shut down the government.' I think it's anti-democratic." Sanders told Bloomberg TV’s Peter Cook that the threats amounted to “blackmail.”    Playground Bullies: It is likely that “something will be worked out by legislators before the government hits crisis mode, but this is no way to run a country, and only one party is to blame,” according to an editorial in the Brattleboro Reformer. As Sen. Sanders noted, a threatened government shutdown will cause a loss of jobs and income for thousands of Americans and hurt seniors, veterans, college students and others.   Low-Wage Federal Workers: A group of senators and congressmen have called on President Barack Obama to sign an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal government contractors, according to a video on Truthout. "We have got to get a handle on raising wages throughout this country so that workers do not depend upon starvation wages," Sen. Sanders said.

A panel of experts appointed by the United Nations on Friday renewed its conclusion that global warming is real, that it is caused by humans and that it is likely to get a lot worse. Sanders supports bold action to limit greenhouse gas emissions but few others in Congress are prepared to confront the coming planetary crisis. Sanders on Wednesday addressed a rally of low-paid government contract workers who marched to the White House as part of a one-day strike for better pay.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Shutdown Showdown: Sen. Sanders answered questions from the public Friday morning about the potential of a government shutdown. “The issue we should be discussing is not Obamacare. The issue is whether it is right for a group of extreme right-wing Republicans to shutdown he government because they haven’t gotten what they wanted,” Sanders told the audience of C-Span’s Washington Journal.   Fair Wages for Federal Workers: The biggest employer of low-wage workers in America is not Wal-Mart or McDonald's but the United States government. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Keith Ellison joined low-wage government contract workers at a White House rally to demand fair pay, the New York Daily News, and Al Jazeera America reported. A letter signed by 15 senators asked the president to order a $10.10 minimum wage for federal contract workers, The New York Times reported online.   VA Mental Health: New electronic mental health systems used by the Department of Veterans Affairs could help prevent the mentally ill from turning violent, according to CBS8 San Diego. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs Chairman Sanders says he will remain committed to ensure veterans who suffer from mental health issues during service are provided the care to which they are entitled to receive.   UN Warns ‘We Must Act’: While discussing a new report on Thursday from United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced “the heat is on. We must act.”  In their starkest warning yet, following nearly seven years of new research on the climate, the IPCC said it was "unequivocal" and that even if the world begins to moderate greenhouse gas emissions, warming is likely to cross the critical threshold of 2C by the end of this century, The Guardian reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  A Living Wage for Workers: About 250 workers marched to the White House on Wednesday and urged President Obama to sign an executive order guaranteeing them a "living wage." A delegation delivered a letter of support from 15 senators, including Bernard Sanders, The Washington Post reported. The senators' urged President Barack Obama to set a special minimum wage of $10.10 per hour for federal contract workers, ABC 22 reported. "Profitable corporations that receive lucrative contracts from the federal government should pay all their workers a decent wage," the letter said.   USPS: The United States Postal Service unveiled a proposal Wednesday that would raise postage prices above the rate of inflation in order to generate $2 billion in new revenue. The idea of cutting Saturday mail service had also been considred, but a congressional funding measure stopped that one. Sen. Sanders said that decision was good news, especially for rural areas, businesses, seniors, veterans and others, WPTZ-TV reported.   Right-Wing Republicans: Sen. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC's Chris Jansing that the Republican effort to defund President Obama’s signature health care legislation would only be the beginning of their right-wing agenda. “Getting rid of Obamacare is nickels and dimes. See what they have to say about getting rid of Medicare as we know it. Massive cuts in Medicaid. How do people live if we get rid of Social Security in this country?” Sanders said. “People do not appreciate how far right the Republican Party has gone,” Sanders added in an Ed Schultz interview later Wednesday on MSNBC.   Senate to Strip Monsanto Rider: Senate Democrats plan to strip a controversial rider allowing large biotech company Monsanto to sidestep court injunctions on seed planting. The so-called "Monsanto Protection Act" was added into a government funding resolution earlier this year, irking environmental and food safety groups. Sen. Sanders opposed the rider, The Raw Story reported.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/092613

The Freedom to Suffer: http://youtu.be/TWnXrNGpEew?t=28s
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders: Obamacare is ‘A Good Republican Program’: Sen. Sanders said Tuesday that the health care reform law doesn't go nearly far enough and reiterated his support of a single-payer, Medicare-for-all universal health care program. The U.S. is the "only nation in the entire industrial world that doesn't guarantee health care as a right," Sanders said on CNN's Crossfire. He called the Affordable Care Act a “good Republican program,” referring to the Massachusetts program by former governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.   Budget Standoff: Congressional Republicans are threatening a government shutdown on Tuesday in their effort to defund President Barack Obama's health care law. “It’s not going to happen,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Vermont Public Radio. “Quite incredibly, what the Republicans are saying is, ‘Yeah we failed 42 times, we lost the presidential election, but now we are prepared to shut down the entire United States government unless we end this legislation,’” Sanders said in a Senate speech on Tuesday.   Crazy Budget Cuts: The Senate is considering a House-passed resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown on Tuesday that would extend across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration. Interviewed Tuesday on The Bill Press Show, Sanders cited a new Census Bureau report that showed median family income today is less than it was 24 years ago and an increase in poverty. “The idea of punishing millions of Americans by radically cutting back on food stamps, by radically cutting back on the needs of people who are on the Meals on Wheels program … is absolutely crazy,” Sanders said.  Workers Protest: Cleaning and concessions workers plan to walk off their jobs in federal buildings Wednesday and march on the White House, where they’ll demand President Obama wield his executive authority to raise labor standards for their taxpayer-funded jobs. The workers serve food or wash floors at the government-owned Union Station, Smithsonian museums, Ronald Reagan Building and Old Post Office. The protests include a press conference outside the White House featuring Sen. Sanders, Salon.com reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/092513
Off the Deep End:   Congressional Republicans are threatening to shut down the federal government next Tuesday unless the Affordable Care Act is defunded. The truth is that they’re just warming up and some of their other ideas are even further “off the deep end,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Bill Press on Tuesday. In a Senate floor speech, Sanders detailed a Republican to-do list that ranges from abolishing Social Security, privatizing VA health care, getting rid of the EPA, junking the minimum wage and more. Those and other proposals, the senator said, are detailed in the Texas Republican Party platform.  The Lone Star Strategy: http://youtu.be/tf7s8mvHVzg
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Countdown to Shutdown: Congress is counting down the days until an Oct. 1 when parts of the government will shut down unless the House and Senate agree on a way to keep funds flowing. “At a time when the middle class is disappearing and poverty is increasing, it is morally wrong and economically dangerous to make significant cuts in programs like Head Start, Meals on Wheels, home heating assistance, nutrition assistance to pregnant mothers and infants and child care,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told the Burlington Free Press. “It is also wrong to force many federal workers to take furloughs – resulting in significant cuts in pay.”   Bullies: Sen. Sanders on Monday criticized a House-passed bill that would cut nutrition programs by $39 billion. “What you’re talking about is the incredible cruelty and arrogance of a party representing the wealthy and the powerful to punish the poor and working people,” Sanders said. “These are bullies who are beating up on helpless people … They don’t impress me.” Sanders told MSNBC's Martin Bashir.   Off the Deep End: Sen. Sanders on Tuesday said a shutdown would “make the United States look incredibly stupid throughout the world” and the threat by Republicans to close the government unless they get their way “makes every American ask, ‘What in god’s name is going on in Washington.’” At a time of massive poverty and falling incomes for middle-class, working families, Sanders said on The Bill Press Show that cutting food stamps, Head Start, Meals on Wheels and other programs is an “absolutely crazy” idea pushed by right-wing Republicans “going off the deep end.”   The Fed: Few remember that 30 senators voted against Ben Bernanke when President Barack Obama nominated him for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2010, Juan Williams wrote for The Hill. Sen. Bernie Sanders led the opposition to his confirmation. The upcoming battle over the new Fed chairman, Williams says, remains crucial in a broader debate about the nation's economic direction.

Bullies:   House Republicans are trying to undo the Affordable Care Act, throw millions of children and the elderly off food stamps and continue across-the-board sequestration cuts that have slashed Head Start, Meals on Wheels, home heating assistance and other programs.  That’s just the agenda for this week when the Republicans are using the threat of a government shutdown on Oct. 1 to try to get their way. “What you’re talking about is the incredible cruelty and arrogance of a party representing the wealthy and the powerful to punish the poor and working people,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Martin Bashir on MSNBC. “These are bullies who are beating up on helpless people … They don’t impress me.”  http://youtu.be/E0V-62m_yoI

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Clock Ticks as Senate Begins Budget Work: Senate leaders will start work Monday on a bill to fund federal agencies into the new fiscal year, but it remains unclear whether Congress can finish the job in time to avoid a partial government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to take steps Monday that likely would lead to an important procedural vote on Wednesday to open debate on the funding bill, according to The Wall Street Journal.   Income Gap: A typical middle-class American family made less last year than in 1989, according to a new Census Bureau report cited Sunday by Chris Moore on KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh, Pa. Meanwhile, Forbes magazine reported that the 400 wealthiest Americans doubled what they were worth a decade ago and finally gained back all they had lost in the 2008 economic collapse. “Do you want to know why the American people are angry and disgusted and frustrated,” Sen. Sanders asked in a Senate floor speech. “That's why.”  Dental Care: Sen. Sanders has introduced a bill to add adult dental care to the Affordable Care Act in 2015. “Providing dental care to more people could significantly reduce medical costs and provide lifesaving, preventive treatment. When the Affordable Care Act expands over the next few years, dental coverage should not and cannot be overlooked. Providing dental care can significantly reduce medical costs …” Ron Inge, executive director of the Institute for Oral Health, wrote in The Seattle Times.   Global Warming: Scientists will this week issue their starkest warning yet about the mounting dangers of global warming. In a report to be handed to political leaders in Stockholm on Monday, they will say that the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have now led to a warming of the entire globe, including land surfaces, oceans and the atmosphere, The Guardian reported. Extreme weather events, including heatwaves and storms, have increased in many regions while ice sheets are dwindling at an alarming rate. In addition, sea levels are rising while the oceans are being acidified – a development that could see the planet's coral reefs disappearing before the end of the century.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Budget Showdown: With just days left until the government runs out of funds to operate, the Republican-led House on Friday passed a funding bill that has no chance of passing in the Senate because it contains a provision that cuts off all funding for the Affordable Care Act, the new national health care law.  After the House vote, Sen. Bernie Sanders told Thom Hartmann that 47 million Americans lack health insurance but the Republicans are "completely ignoring this reality."  Stop the Sequester: Senate Democrats plan to not only strip language defunding Obamacare from the House-passed funding bill but also push for increased spending on programs that have been subject to across-the-board spending cuts. “Sequestration is an absolute disaster. It’s causing enormous harm right now. It will continue to cause enormous harm,” Sen. Sanders told The Hill. LINK   Monsanto Protection: The measure to fund the federal government that passed the House on Friday included a rider that shields companies like Monsanto from lawsuits over genetically modified crops , the New York Daily News reported. In the Senate, Sens. Sanders and Jeff Merkley oppose the special protection.  Community Development: Sen. Sanders returned to City Hall on Friday to celebrate Burlington’s progress over the past 30 years through the Community and Economic Development Office.

Bernie Sanders worried that might be just what Tea Party Republicans want. “They believe, in fact, that a government shutdown is not necessarily a bad thing because they don’t believe much in government,” Sanders said on Thursday. The budget brinksmanship capped a week when the House voted on Thursday to throw 4 million hungry children, seniors and others off food stamps, when a Census Bureau report on Tuesday showed middle-class family income is less now than a generation ago, and when the capital city was on edge after a gunman on Monday killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard two miles from the Capitol.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   House Cuts Food Stamps: House Republicans on Thursday voted to cut nearly $40 billion from nutrition programs over a decade and push 4 million Americans off food stamps beginning next year. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the 217-to-210 vote “beyond shameful.” The United States, he added in an interview on MSNBC, “cannot go to war against people who are struggling to keep their heads above water.” The vote dashed hopes for passage this year of a new five-year farm bill.   Government Shutdown: Looms House Republicans are prepared to "dismember the United States government and wreak havoc on the lives of tens and tens of millions of people,” Sen. Sanders said on WCAX-TV. "They believe, in fact, that a government shutdown is not necessarily a bad thing because they don’t believe much in government," Sanders said on The Ed Schultz Show.   More Cuts Coming: Even if a shutdown is averted, the House resolution to keep the government running would freeze in place cuts that are $70 billion below the figure agreed to in prior negotiations, according to The Huffington Post. Sen. Sanders listed some of the effects of sequestration: 57,000 children knocked off Head Start; tens of thousands of seniors dropped from Meals on Wheels; cuts to housing assistance for the elderly and disabled; work-study programs cut for 70,000 college students; cancer patients losing Medicare treatments, and 400,000 elderly and other low-income households losing heating assistance this winter.   Tax Scam: Sen. Sanders is among 12 senators calling on the Justice Department to investigate tax-lien programs that in Washington, D.C. alone have cost dozens of families their homes. A Washington Post investigation found that investors bought tax liens and then charged homeowners legal fees and other costs that far exceeded the original tax bills. When homeowners were unable to pay, the investors foreclosed. One 95-year-old woman, Daisy Dolsey, lost a $300,000 house that had been in her family for half a century over a $44.79 tax debt.

War on Working Families:   With a government shutdown looming, the House set a Friday vote on a stopgap spending measure to run the government through Dec. 15. The continuing resolution would take away funds to implement the new Obamacare health care program. It also would extend automatic spending cuts, the so-called sequestration, in programs like Head Start and Meals on Wheels. “We are looking at a real effort to dismantle the United States government and wreak havoc on the lives of millions and millions of people,” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech. He discussed the budget showdown with radio host Ed Schultz. Then, later on  Thursday, the House narrowly voted to cut funds for food stamps. The senator talked about that moments after the vote with the Rev. Al Sharpton on MSNBC.  Watch Sen. Sanders on MSNBC: http://youtu.be/4oZp_BXz0qc

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   House GOP Ties Government Funding to Health Law: House Republicans said Wednesday that stripping funding from the health-care law championed by President Obama would be their price for keeping federal agencies open after the end of this month, a move that sharply increases the risk of a partial government shutdown in two weeks, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Budget Showdown: The House set a vote Friday on a stopgap spending measure to finance the government through Dec. 15 by extending automatic spending cuts that took effect in March, known as sequestration.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, who sits on the Senate Budget Committee, said it would be a "tragic mistake" and a "terrible precedent" if the Senate were to go along with the House and further slash programs for children, the elderly and working families, The Colchester Sun reported. The House measure also would block funding for the new health care law, under which the uninsured will be enrolled beginning on Oct. 1.  Global Warming: Sen. Barbara Boxer pledged Wednesday to push a carbon tax as part of a broader tax reform effort on Capitol Hill, reported The Daily Caller. Sens. Boxer and Sanders previously introduced legislation that would place a fee on carbon emissions, starting at $20 per ton in 2014 and rising to $35 per ton over twelve years.   Disgruntled Democrats: In a New York Times story about Democrats’ frustration with President Obama, Sen. Sanders said, "If you read the papers, you almost think the Republicans are in control... Democrats are on the defensive." The White House reaction to Politico’s Mike Allen was to say Sanders is not a Democrat. The Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart argued that Larry Summers’ withdrawal from consideration for the Federal Reserve chairmanship was a win for liberals.

This morning Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, snapped a picture of Sen. Sanders walking to work with his grandson.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama Fatigue: Disgruntled Democrats have bolted from a White House that they complain has not consulted Congress enough, failed to assert leadership, has been too passive and ceded momentum to Republicans. “If you read the papers, you almost think the Republicans are in control,” Sen. Bernard Sanders told The New York Times. “They're constantly on the offensive. Democrats are on the defensive.” The lack of strong leadership, Sanders added, has created a vacuum. “'I think you're going to see more independents saying, ‘Mr. President, we look forward to working with you, but we're not simply going to accept your leadership and your ideas. 'We're not going to follow you. You're going to have to work with us.’ ”  Sanders Heads South: Sen. Sanders is heading to South Carolina next month for the South Carolina Progressive Network fall retreat, the Charleston City Paper reported. "We look forward to Senator Sanders sharing his vision for our nation with us," said Donna DeWitt, president of the South Carolina Alliance for Retired Americans, which is cosponsoring the event.   Household Incomes: Despite the addition of more than two million jobs last year, soaring corporate profits and continuing economic growth, income for the typical American household did not rise in 2012 and poverty failed to fall, new data from the Census Bureau show. “The poverty and income numbers are a metaphor for the entire economy,” Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution told The New York Times. “Everything’s on hold, but at a bad level.” Over a longer perspective, the figures reveal that the income of the median American household today, adjusted for inflation, is no higher than it was for the equivalent household in the late 1980s.   Food Stamps: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program kept 4 million Americans out of poverty in 2012 according to Tuesday's annual update from the Congressional Budget Office. New analysis shows that 3.8 million Americans would lose food stamps under a House Republican proposal to cut spending by 5 percent, The Huffington Post reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Navy Yard Shooting A gunman killed a dozen people as the workday began at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday. The FBI identified the shooter as Aaron Alexis, 34, of Fort Worth, who in 2011 received a general discharge from the Navy Reserve, a designation that usually signals a problem in his record. Alexis was arrested but not charged in a gun incident in Seattle in 2004 but still had a security clearance with a military contractor that allowed him access to the Navy Yard, officials told The Washington Post.   Obama vs. Democrats Larry Summers' withdrawal from consideration to be Federal Reserve chairman and congressional opposition to President Barack Obama’s call for a military strike against Syria highlighted fissures between the president and fellow Democrats. “There are many issues … where the president is moving in a direction which is very different from [what] the people who voted for him want," Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Boston Globe. Senate Democrats “have a lot of respect and affection for the president but I do believe there is growing concern about his political judgment," Sanders told The Associated Press.   Party Fissures Bared The recent events “have also showed the power of a resurgent liberal Democratic wing,” according to a Wall Street Journal article that said Sen. Sanders “was one of several congressional Democrats to reject the president's planned pick for the Fed.”   A Powerful Clique Summers was the last of a group of economists, along with now Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew, who were responsible for deregulation ahead of the financial crisis, according to a New York magazine article which recalled that Sens. Sanders and Kent Conrad criticized Lew's assertion that deregulation was not "a proximate cause" of the crisis. Sanders, according to Seven Days, said the American people are ready for a Fed chairman "prepared to stand up to the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.”    Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/newswatch/091713

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Summers Out of Running for the Fed: Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers withdrew on Sunday from consideration to succeed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke amid fierce opposition from within the Democratic Party over Summers’ role in deregulating Wall Street. “I applaud Larry Summers for withdrawing his name from consideration,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said late Sunday. ''The truth is that it was unlikely he would have been confirmed by the Senate,'' Sanders added in The New York Times, The Washington Post and Reuters and online in The Wall Street Journal.   Summers Faced Growing Opposition: Along with independent Sen. Sanders, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, a member of the Banking Committee, last week became the third Democrat to declare opposition to Summers’ nomination, Bloomberg reported. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another committee member, reportedly told the administration that she had "serious concerns" about the prospect of a Summers nomination.  In August, Warren worked with Sanders on a letter that raised a series of questions for whoever is nominated to chair the Fed, John Nichols blogged for The Nation.   House Plans Cuts for Seniors, Children: Sen. Sanders said the Senate must call the bluff of the House Republicans demanding deeper cuts on programs designed to help working families, ABC 22 and Fox 44 reported. Under a proposal set for a House vote this week, “more Americans will lose their jobs ... more children will be thrown off of Head Start... more Americans will be unable to afford to send their kids to child care," Sanders said on WPTZ-TV.   Syria: The Russian-American deal to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal gives President Obama some breathing space after a politically damaging few weeks. But the list of things that could still go wrong is extensive and daunting, according to The New York Times.

Summers Pulls Out:   Former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers on Sunday withdrew as a candidate for Federal Reserve chairman to replace Ben Bernanke when his term runs out in January. The former Obama adviser faced mounting opposition in the Senate from, among others, Sen. Bernie Sanders.  “I applaud Larry Summers for withdrawing his name from consideration. The truth is that it was unlikely he would have been confirmed by the Senate,” Sanders said in a statement on Sunday. “What the American people want now is a Fed chairman prepared to stand up to the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street, not a Wall Street insider whose deregulation efforts helped pave the way for a horrendous financial crisis and the worst economic downturn in the country since the Great Depression. The Fed now must help develop policies which create millions of decent-paying jobs and rebuild the middle class.”  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=E5D5F40B-6819-4024-BE61-AD279C967F49
Don't Cave on Cuts:   The Senate must call the bluff of House Republicans who are demanding deeper cuts in Head Start, Meals on Wheels and other programs for working families, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Sunday. A proposal set for a House vote this week includes the deeper spending cuts in a continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down after the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. The proposal would lock in across-the-board cuts known as sequestration but carve out an exception for the Pentagon, which would get a $20-billion boost.  A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders said it would be a “tragic mistake” and a “terrible precedent” if the Senate were to go along with the House and further slash programs for children, the elderly, working families and the most vulnerable people in this country.   If the Senate accepts the House Republican plan, Sanders said in a letter to Senate colleagues, “more Americans will lose their jobs; more children will be thrown off of Head Start; more Americans will be unable to afford to send their kids to child care; more teachers will be thrown out on the street; more senior citizens will go hungry; and more working families will be unable to heat their homes this winter.  In the richest country on the face of the earth,  that would be morally repugnant and bad economic policy.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=D6AAD261-CAB5-4085-B6FA-C44B67729CF6
No More War Abroad, More Jobs at Home - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), The Huffington Post:   At a time of great political division in our country President Obama has found a remarkable way to unite Americans of all political persuasions -- conservatives, progressives and moderates. With a loud and clear voice, the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying NO to another war in the Middle East -- Syria's bloody and complicated civil war.  There are two major reasons why the people in this country are adamantly opposed to the U.S.'s military intervention in Syria.  First, of course, is the much discussed "war weariness." The United States has been at war in Afghanistan for 12 years, and the war in Iraq dragged on for nearly nine years. The cost of these wars has been horrendous: more than 6,700 American deaths; hundreds of thousands suffering from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder; and a financial cost of between $4 trillion to $6 trillion by the time the last war veteran receives needed care. Further, as a result of the ineptitude and dishonesty of foreign policy decisions made in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, the American people worry deeply about the unintended consequences of another military venture.  But there's another reason why Americans are reluctant to get involved in a third Middle East war in 12 years. And that relates to the fact that Congress today has a 14 percent favorability rating and millions of Americans have absolutely no confidence that the U.S. House or Senate is even remotely concerned about their needs or views.  Here's the truth. The middle class in this country is collapsing. The number of Americans living in poverty is nearly the highest on record and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And very few people in Washington give a damn.  Continue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/the-american-people-have_b_3916584.html
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  U.S., Russia Agree on Syrian Chemical Weapons: The United States and Russia agreed Saturday on a plan to bring Syrian chemical weapons under international control, a rare diplomatic victory in a brutal civil war that appears to head off a punitive U.S. military strike on Syria in the near future. In announcing the deal, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said the agreement would be backed by a U.N. Security Council resolution that could allow for sanctions or other consequences if Syria fails to comply, The Washington Post reported from Geneva.   The Fed: The chances that Larry H. Summers, said to be President Barack Obama’s favored candidate to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, would win confirmation are falling sharply as Democrats come out against the possible nomination of the former Treasury Secretary. Jon Tester would vote against Summers in committee if the president nominated him, his office said on Friday. Earlier, another Banking Democrat, Sen. Sherrod Brown, told CQ Roll Call he would “likely” vote against Summers’ nomination in committee. Sen. Jeff Merkley is a likely “no” vote as well.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The Fed: President Barack Obama would face opposition from within his own party if he were to nominate Lawrence Summers to head the Federal Reserve. There is so much “Democratic antipathy to Mr. Summers that Mr. Obama will have to sweat on a bloc of Republican votes in the Senate to get him across the line,” according to Financial Times. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley have indicated they will vote against Summers and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren penned an op-ed entitled "Four questions for Fed chair candidates," including whether the nominee would "work to break up 'too-big-to-fail' financial institutions."  Obama and the Left: President Obama's push to use military force against the Syrian regime highlighted his many differences with liberals who believe the president has fallen short of his progressive mandate, according to Politico. Several progressives, including Sens. Sanders and Brown, did not back a military authorization bill and others, such as Rep. Alan Grayson, opposed it outright.   Koch Brothers: Charles and David Koch funneled $250 million to right-wing causes last year through a secretive organization called Freedom Partners which supports the United States Chamber of Commerce, Think Progress reported. The chamber consistently has supported the Export-Import Bank, which Sen. Sanders once called "corporate welfare at its worst."

The Week in Review:   With the backdrop of Saturday’s fifth anniversary of Lehman Brothers’ crash and the Wall Street-caused recession that followed, surveys showed that Americans continue to overwhelmingly dislike and distrust Wall Street and worry about our economy. That sentiment and frustration with Washington’s failure to deal with jobs and low wages fueled overwhelming public opposition to President Obamas’ push for military strikes against Syria. Obama on Tuesday put aside plans for military intervention to pursue a proposal for international monitors to take over Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal.

Dental Crisis in America: http://youtu.be/vhIwtMLEGrM  A Senate panel heard today that millions of Americans do not have access to dentists because of skyrocketing costs and inadequate insurance coverage. “We can and must address the dental crisis in America now,” Sen.

A new report prepared by the Government Accountability Office said Americans spent about $108 billion on dentists in 2011.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Dental Crisis: Sen. Sanders chaired a Senate hearing on Thursday to call attention to the high cost of dental care and ways to improve access to oral health care for all Americans. The Senate panel learned that more than 47 million Americans live in places where adequate dental care is difficult to access and 130 million do not have dental insurance, reported WPTZ-TV and other NBC News affiliates, KWTC-TV in Oklahoma City, Okla., and other CBS News affiliates, CBS Radio, KNX-AM all-news radio in Los Angeles, The Associated Press, Washington Times, Congressional Quarterly and others.   The American People Have Spoken: "With a loud and clear voice the overwhelming majority of the American people, across the political spectrum, are saying no to another war in the Middle East," Sen. Sanders wrote for The Huffington Post, Daily Kos, and Green Mountain Daily. Building on that momentum, Sanders said Americans must demand action on important domestic issues. "Now is the time to use that same energy and passion to save the middle class," he wrote.  Where’s Obama on Jobs?: President Obama just waged an unprecedented campaign to sell Americans on the need to go to war. Some in Congress want him to bring the same focus to jobs and other domestic priorities. “I raised this issue to the president the other day,” Sen. Sanders told Yahoo News. “It’s one thing to give a speech which most people know really is not going to translate into terribly strong action,” Sanders said. “Intensity is the key issue. Is he prepared to fight?” Sanders declined to describe Obama’s response, but a congressional aide who does not work for Sanders said the exchange was a bit combative, with the senator asking, in effect, “Why the hell aren’t we talking about jobs?”   Syria: Americans, from both red states and blue states, are strongly opposed to a war in Syria and are telling their members of Congress, The Huffington Post reported. Sen. Sanders said that "95 percent of my constituents have indicated to me in emails and phone calls that they do not want to see the United States getting involved in a bloody and complicated civil war in Syria - and that certainly has some influence on me."

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Geneva Talks Mark Big Test for U.S., Russia: Secretary of State John Kerry will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday to discuss a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Syria, “I am pleased to see that the president and his administration are now working with Russia, France, the UK, China and the United Nations to remove chemical weapons from Syria without involving the United States in the bloody and complicated Syrian civil war. This is a good step forward,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in the Times Argus and Rutland Herald. Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy both support diplomatic proposals to remove chemical weapons from Syria, WCAX-TV reported.  Obama Must Not Surrender to Class Warfare: President Barack Obama now must turn his focus from Syria to championing progressive solutions to the nation's pressing domestic issues. “The president has got to say, ‘I stand with the working families of the United States, and if the billionaires hate me, so be it.’ He's got to draw the line in the sand... on the class warfare going on in America.” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC's Ed Schultz Wednesday.  Obama's Unpopular War: President Barack Obama is paying a high political price for his support of unpopular military strikes in Syria, according to an Al Jazeera America report. Sen. Sanders "assailed" the president and Congress for not focusing on important domestic issues. “What about our kids?” he asked. “What kind of future are they going to have in a country where the middle class continues to disappear?”   9/11 Remembered: The 12th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were commemorated Wednesday in New York City, Washington, D.C., and western Pennsylvania. “Those events transformed this country,” Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama Delays Syria Strike: President Obama, facing opposition in Congress and around the country to a strike in Syria, said Tuesday that he would hold off on military action for now and pursue a Russian proposal for international monitors to take over and destroy Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons. “I believe that the American people share the president’s concerns about chemical weapons in Syria and the brutal Assad dictatorship. But, in overwhelming numbers, Vermonters are telling me they want those issues addressed diplomatically by the UN and the international community — not by unilateral military action on the part of the U.S.,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press.   Sanders: Focus on Middle Class: Sen. Sanders said Vermonters and the American people want Obama and Congress to focus on more pressing matters hitting closer to home such as the middle class and high unemployment, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported. “The American people are saying very loudly and clearly that this country faces enormous crises, economically, global warming, health care, education income and wealth inequality and they want us to start addressing those needs,” Sanders said on Vermont Public Radio. “There is a reason why the vast majority of Americans disapprove of the work that Congress is doing. Vermonters and the American people want President Obama and Congress to focus on the major crises facing the collapsing middle class — high unemployment, low wages, growing wealth and income inequality, the high cost of college, global warming and many other issues,” Sanders said in the Free Press.   Obama Failed to Win Senate Support for Syria Strikes: Only about one in 10 members of Congress are currently supporting strikes in Syria, CBS News estimated. The network tally said Sen. Sanders was one of six senators leaning against supporting military intervention, reflecting overwhelming public opposition. “Every once in a while democracy actually works, not very often around here, but the Congress is hearing their message. The president didn't have the votes,” Sen. Sanders told U.S. News & World Report.   Seize the Opportunity: Sen. Sanders told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux earlier on Tuesday that he hoped the president "seizes the opportunity" for international efforts to rid Syria of chemical weapons "without the United States getting unilaterally involved" in Syria's civil war. “We’re moving in the right direction and I applaud the American people for making it very clear that they understand that getting involved in a Syrian civil war could have huge implications. The American people are saying to the Congress, ‘Why don’t you pay attention to our needs?’” Sanders told Bloomberg News. Sanders was cautiously optimistic about the tentative proposal which would require Syria to transfer its weapons stockpile, VtDigger reported.

Seize the Moment:  Headed into a meeting of senators with President Obama in the Capitol, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday said he hopes the president seizes an opportunity to rid Syria of chemical weapons and avert a military attack by the United States. “What I want to hear from the president is that he recognizes that the overwhelming majority of the American people do not want to get sucked into a war in Syria,” Sanders said on CNN.   “The American people are saying, ‘You know what, Mr. President, the middle class is collapsing. Our kids can’t find jobs. Why don’t we as a government start paying attention to the enormous needs we have in America.’ I hope the president recognizes that and now seizes the opportunity that Russia and France have offered us to get these terrible chemical weapons out of Syria without the United States getting unilaterally involved in this bloody and complicated war.” A Russian proposal for Syria to transfer control of its chemical weapons to international inspectors was embraced by Syria earlier on Tuesday. France said it would draft a U.N. Security Council resolution to implement the plan. China and Iran voiced support.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Military Strikes against Syria on Hold: President Obama on Monday tentatively embraced a Russian diplomatic proposal to avert a United States military strike on Syria by having international monitors take control of the Syrian government’s chemical weapons. “My sense is that it is really good news,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told PBS’ Tavis Smiley on Monday. “Russia is jumping in in a constructive way … If they can force Syria for the first time … to acknowledge that they have chemical weapons … and to allow the international community to secure those chemical weapons, then that would be a huge step forward.”   Sanders Hopes for Peaceful Resolution: Sen. Sanders voiced a cautious optimism late Monday that the United States might yet find a peaceful resolution to its standoff with Syria. “Most Americans would support an effort that could remove chemical weapons from Syria without American military involvement in another Middle East war," he said, according to Seven Days. "I urge the president and Russia to work vigorously to achieve that goal."   Senate Vote Delayed: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Monday that he would not force an initial vote this week on a resolution authorizing military force against Syria. Sen. Sanders welcomed the delay to pursue a diplomatic solution. “As somebody who is not enthusiastic about getting into a war for all kinds of reasons, I think it would been seen by the entire global community as a wonderful victory if you can get chemical weapons out of Syria without the United States getting involved in a bloody war,” Sanders said on PBS.  Senate Opposition to Military Action Increasing: The decision to put off a Senate vote came as opposition to a U.S. strike on Syria was growing even among Obama’s allies and former Senate colleagues. On Monday, six senators — five Republicans and Democrat Heidi Heitkamp — came out against the Syria resolution. Sen. Sanders told Politico that 95 percent of his constituents oppose military strikes against Syria “and that certainly has some influence on me.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=67BB7B2F-7FBB-40A1-B627-5E3364A975B5

As Congress Debates Syria, U.S. Labor Force Hits 35-Year Low:  A key concern of Sen. Bernie Sanders about President Obama’s request for the United States to launch military strikes against Syria is that it would divert Congress and the president from dealing with jobs and other important but overlooked issues here at home. “If we get sucked into a civil war in Syria, it will be harder to deal with 14 percent unemployment or 20 percent youth unemployment or 40 percent black youth unemployment, and the many, many other problems that this country faces,” Sanders said on Monday on MSNBC.  There was, for example, startling but barely-noticed news in the unemployment report for August, when the share of the population in the workforce hit a 35-year law. The size of the workforce declined by about 300,000 and the participation rate fell to 63.2 percent from 63.4 percent—the lowest since August 1978, according to an analysis by Peter Coy for Bloomberg Businessweek. The participation rate is the number of people either working or actively searching for work as a share of the working-age population.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   International Response Needed on Syria: Sen. Bernie Sanders said the United States should work with the world community in responding to Syria’s use of chemical weapons. After more than a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan “how about coming home and addressing the crisis facing the American people?” Sanders said on MSNBC. “If we want to deal with a crisis, let’s deal with unemployment, let’s deal with health care, let’s deal with education. We have enough on our own hands,” the senator added.   Americans Oppose Intervention in Syria: Sen. Sanders said that more than nine out of 10 calls and emails to his office over the past week opposed U.S. action in Syria. The senator also said he's worried that the "surgical strike" against Syria could prompt a push for greater U.S. involvement to bring about a regime change, WPTZ-TV reported. Sanders said the public wants Congress to address issues affecting working families, WCAX-TV reported.   White House Turns up Heat: Proponents of striking Syria are banking on getting lawmakers away from anti-war town halls and into classified briefings. Sen. Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats, said Democrats he's spoken with feel the tug of party loyalty and not wanting to undercut Obama so publicly. But he told National Journal that such loyalty doesn't typically outweigh overwhelming public opposition.   Congress Ignores Jobs: The 7.3 percent of Americans unemployed in August was down from 8.1 percent unemployment a year ago, but the improvement is happening slowly and there's no reason to expect Washington to step in and speed things up. Since 2009, Congress hasn't passed major legislation aimed at helping to shrink the nation's massive pool of unemployed, according to National Journal.

NEWS: Sen. Sanders Airs Concerns on Syria:  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this afternoon reiterated his concerns about U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war.  In an interview on MSNBC, Sanders made three points. First, he said that more than 9 out of 10 calls and emails to his office in the past week were against unilateral U.S. action against Syria. “The calls that are coming into my office are overwhelmingly against getting involved in a bloody and complicated civil war in Syria,” Sanders told anchor Alex Witt.  Second, at a time when the U.S. faces major domestic crises in terms of high unemployment, low wages, massive income and wealth inequality and the planetary threat of global warming, he feared very much that U.S. involvement in Syria would make it even harder for the U.S. government to address the enormous problems facing the American middle class. “The American people are profoundly disgusted with the fact that the United States Congress continues to ignore the enormously serious problems facing the middle class of this country,” Sanders said.  Third, the senator worried that the “surgical strike” against Syria advocated by President Barack Obama could turn into a much deeper engagement and a push for “regime change.” He noted that a resolution passed last week by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee contained language that could become a basis for broader U.S. involvement. If that occurred, the U.S. involvement could take years, cost billions of dollars and possibly involve U.S. troops.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Americans Oppose U.S. Force in Syria: Sen. Bernie Sanders reports there is 10-1 opposition to authorizing the use of force in Syria in an online survey of constituents. Calls to his offices are even more overwhelming, according to an editorial on Sunday in the The(Madison, Wis.) Capital Times.  Vermont Delegation Split on Syria: Sen. Patrick Leahy, the country's most senior senator, appears set to support U.S. intervention. Sen. Sanders has voiced reservations while Rep. Peter Welch remains on the fence, WCAX-TV reported on Saturday.  Kerry Meets Arab Leaders on Syria: Secretary of State John Kerry is meeting Arab League leaders in Paris as part of a European tour to gather support for intervention in Syria. Kerry said the number of nations prepared to take military action was now in "double digits", but the list has not been made public. France strongly supports intervention in response to the use of chemical weapons in Damascus last month, but it wants to wait for a report by UN weapons experts before taking action, BBC reported.  Health Care: “A new and affordable way for many Vermonters to purchase insurance is the key provision of the Affordable Care Act. I was proud to be involved in the passage of this law when I worked as the health policy adviser for Sen. Sanders,” David Reynolds, deputy director of health reform in the Vermont Agency of Administration, wrote for the Rutland Herald and Times Argus.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Americans Oppose Syria Attack: Americans have deluged their congressmen with phone calls, emails and online-survey responses to make their opposition known to the possibility of the U.S. striking Syria. "We're just detecting very little support for this proposal," Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Wall Street Journal. The senator's office had received 1,856 calls, faxes and emails for the week from constituents as of early Friday afternoon and 1,740 were opposed and 116 in favor. Of 488 phone calls to Sanders, there were only10 in support, The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe said on “Washington Week” on PBS. Chris Matthews on MSNBC said Sanders is hearing almost unanimously from people saying do not get involved.    Public Says No to War: The White House's chances of winning congressional support for military action in Syria look increasingly worse as members of Congress hear from constituents overwhelmingly opposed to military intervention, according to a Washington Post report that said Sen. Sanders told a local television station his phones were "bopping off the hook" with calls from those opposed to military strikes. Thousands headed to Sen. Sanders' website and opposed military action in Syria by a margin of 10 to 1, Vermont Public Television and The Thom Hartmann Program reported. “Bernie Sanders said most of the calls coming into his office were against this effort. I can tell you, 99 percent of the calls coming into my office are against it,” Rep. Elijah Cummings said on MSNBC.  ‘War is the Enemy of the Poor’: The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was right, Sen. Sanders told Tavis Smiley in a public radio interview. “If we get involved in a prolonged effort in Syria, who do you think is going to be paying for that?  … It will undoubtedly mean more cuts for programs that low-income and working families need. It will mean more kids being thrown off Head Start to pay for the war, more elderly people being thrown off the Meals on Wheels program, more kids not being able to go to college in order to pay for the war. That is the economic reality,” Sanders said.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=c1a96894-6d85-4145-91ba-d29037d889c1

The Week in Review:   President Obama called on Congress to back military strikes against Syria. While saying “there is no debate about the horrors of chemical warfare or the ruthless nature of the Assad regime,” Sen. Bernie Sanders voiced “very deep concerns” about military intervention. He asked why it is in the interest of the United States to get involved in a complicated and bloody civil war. He questioned what Obama’s “surgical strikes” would really achieve. He was apprehensive that some on Congress want a broader war aimed at regime change. He had misgivings about taking action without the UN or NATO. He was uneasy that getting involved in a third war in 12 years in the Middle East would keep Congress from focusing on jobs and other priorities that the American people think it should be addressing.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders Fears Broader U.S. War in Syria: Sen. Bernie Sanders voiced concern on Thursday that some on Congress want to use President Barack Obama’s call for “surgical strikes” to punish Syria for using chemical weapons as a pretext for a broader war aimed at regime change, according to WCAX-TV and The Thom Hartmann Program. A divided Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution with language authorizing a broader war, Sanders said on Al Jazeera America. “If the effort does not go well, sometime in the future it could … mean American troops on the ground,” Sanders said Thursday on MSNBC.   War Protesters in Vermont: About 45 demonstrators on Thursday marched to the offices of Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch, WCAX-TV, NECN-TV, The Associated Press and the Burlington Free Press reported. Vermont Public Radio, Fox 44 and ABC 22 said Sanders met with protesters. “We have a dysfunctional Congress today that is basically unable to address issues. What do you think will happen if we get involved in another war?” Sanders is leaning against voting for military action, according to Seven Days.

Sanders will be interviewed on Oct. 5 by Herrick Herzberg during part of the magazine’s annual festival that also will feature authors, actors, journalists and others.

Sanders on Syria: http://youtu.be/ynEU9dIDNJw Weigh in here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/
Not Another Quagmire:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday  questioned  provisions in the latest version of a Senate resolution authorizing military action against Syria that could lay the foundation for broad-scale U.S. military involvement in overthrowing the regime of Bashar Assad. “I don’t sense that the American people have much appetite to get involved in what could be a real quagmire,” the senator told Thom Hartmann. Sanders spoke of the horrors of chemical warfare and  the ruthless nature of the Assad regime, but questioned language added to a Senate resolution to give President Obama authority to “change the momentum on the battlefield in Syria.” Sanders said that push by Sen. John McCain and others for regime change is one of his "serious reservations" about authorizing military action against Syria. “If that policy prevails, there is no question that it could cost tens of billions of dollars and the possible future involvement of American troops,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate Weighs Military Strikes Against Syria: Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday on MSNBC that he is “keeping an open mind” but has “very deep concerns” about President Obama's proposal to punish Syria with military strikes for using chemical weapons on its own citizens. “We’ve cut back on education, we’ve cut back on nutrition programs, we’ve thrown kids off Head Start. We have billions to spend on a war but no money to take care of the very pressing needs of the American people. That bothers me a lot,” Sanders told Ed Schultz.   Leaning 'No':  Vermont's delegation remained undecided, but Sanders is concerned that even limited military action might lead to a larger U.S. involvement in Syria's bloody civil war, Vermont Public Radio reported. “I worry very much that with this rush into war, the very serious problems facing Vermonters and people all over this country … will be pushed aside,” Sanders told The Vermont Press Bureau. “So there will be less discussion about creating jobs, less discussion about making college affordable, less discussion about protecting … Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.” In Seven Days and Politico, Sanders also was said to be leaning against intervention.   Caregivers for Veterans: The Department of Veterans Affairs said Wednesday it supports expanding a caregivers benefit for seriously wounded veterans if Congress come up with the billions needed to pay for the expansion, The Associated Press reported. Sen. Sanders sponsored a bill to enroll an additional 70,000 caregivers in the program by 2016. Under the legislation, any veteran with a "serious-service connected disability" would qualify for caregiver assistance.   U.S. Dismisses U.N. Inspections in Syria: The Obama administration has asserted that the findings by United Nations experts of alleged chemical attacks no longer matter, citing its own evidence that the Syrian government was behind the attack last month in the Damascus suburbs. Few lawmakers have pressed the administration to wait for the inspectors to release their results. Weapons experts say the on-the-ground analysis could confirm key forensic details about the attack, possibly bolster the case against the Syrian government and help rally international support for action, according to The Washington Post.

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday said a drumbeat for military strikes against Syria “speaks to the degree to which Congress is way out of touch” with the priorities of the American people. He cited jobs and global warming among priorities that are important to Americans but lost in the debate on Syria. He also asked how a U.S. military intervention would be paid for. “We’ve cut back on education, we’ve cut back on nutrition programs, we’ve thrown kids off Head Start. We have billions to spend on a war but no money to take care of the very pressing needs of the American people. That bothers me a lot,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Syria: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee could vote today on authorizing the use of force in Syria after the panel's top members drafted a resolution late Tuesday that permits President Obama to order a "limited and tailored" military mission against Syria. Republican and Democratic leaders in the House on Tuesday backed an attack on Syria. The Senate was “all over the map” according to Politico, which said Sen. Bernie Sanders was seen as a potential ‘no’ vote. Sanders said on WAMC-FM that he wants to know why “it is in the best interests of the United States to intervene in Syria's bloody and complicated civil war.” Radio host Thom Hartmann said Sanders may block military intervention. Time called Sanders “part of the antiwar left.” In a Rutland Herald letter to the editor, Judy and Michael Olinick pleaded for the Vermont congressional delegation to “please do all you can to dissuade Obama and John Kerry from this criminal folly.”   Syrian Refugees: Ongoing civil war fighting in Syria has forced more than 2 million people out of the country and more than 4 million others are displaced within its borders, according to a United Nations report cited by CBS News.   U.S. May Step up Rebel Support: The Obama administration is considering putting the Pentagon in charge of arming and training moderate rebel forces in Syria, a move that could help expand the effort significantly beyond the limited scope of the current Central Intelligence Agency program, U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal.   ‘Something Rare in America’: Sen. Sanders, who will headline this weekend’s Fighting Bob Fest in Madison, Wis., is proud to talk about his proposals “to reform the tax code in a way that protects the middle class, working families, and the most vulnerable while making sure that the wealthiest Americans and most profitable corporations pay their fair share.” Other senators may want to operate in secret, but Sanders is proud to discuss his plans. That’s what makes Sanders something rare in America: a senator who has good ideas — and the courage to advance them, publicly and without apology,” John Nichols wrote in The Capital Times.

The Senate Debates Syria:   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held the first public hearing Tuesday on President Obama’s request for Congress to authorize a military strike against Syria in response to last month's chemical attack outside Damascus. “The use of chemical weapons by the Assad dictatorship is inhumane and a violation of international law,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders. “However, at this point in time, I need to hear more from the president as to why he believes it is in the best interests of the United States to intervene in Syria's bloody and complicated civil war. I look forward to the Senate debate that will be taking place in the very near future.”  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9F515BC1-AAD9-444B-AD61-32C5DB5568E1
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Syria: President Obama and his supporters on Capitol Hill will have to overcome broad skepticism about the merits of military strikes against Syria. It is possible they will lose some liberal senators, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, USA Today reported online. Sanders said Saturday that that he wants to hear from Obama why it is in “the best interests of the United States to intervene in Syria's bloody and complicated civil war.”  Vermont's congressional delegation is taking a wait-and-see stance, according to online reports by vtdigger.org and Seven Days.   Obama Presses Congress on Syria: The Obama administration launched a campaign to persuade Congress to authorize military action against Syria. Officials said they are willing to rewrite the proposed resolution to clarify that any operation would be limited and not include ground troops. Secretary of State John Kerry told House Democrats that the United States faced a “Munich moment,” a reference to the 1938 agreement between Adolf Hitler and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. After meeting with the president Monday at the White House, Sen. John McCain warned of “catastrophic” consequences if Congress rejects the resolution.

Bernie Sanders condemned the use of chemical weapons by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “The use of chemical weapons by the Assad dictatorship is inhumane and a violation of international law. However, at this point in time, I need to hear more from the president as to why he believes it is in the best interests of the United States to intervene in Syria’s bloody and complicated civil war,” Sanders said in Monday’s Bennington Banner.  Sanders Opposed Iraq War Resolution: As Congress embarks on a debate over whether to launch a strike against Syria, it's worth looking at the most recent vote for the authorization of force against Iraq in 2002. When President George W. Bush asked Congress to go to war against Iraq in the fall of 2002, the resolution was introduced by leaders of both parties in each chamber: The measure passed the House 296 to 133 and the Senate 77 to 23. The one independent in the House at the time, Sanders, voted no, according to The Washington Post online.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Asks Congress to Back Strike on Syria: In an about face, President Obama announced on Saturday at the White House that he would seek approval from Congress to attack Syria. That stopped the clock for at least a week on what had loomed as an imminent attack. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the apparent use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime “inhumane and a violation of international law,” but added, “I need to hear more from the president as to why he believes it is in the best interests of the United States to intervene in Syria’s bloody and complicated civil war,” the Burlington Free Press, Valley News, WCAX-TV and WPTZ-TV reported.  Senate: Harry Reid said Saturday he’d try to bring the Senate back early for a vote, meaning it will say yes first and add to the drama in the House, according to The Daily Beast. Obama might lose a very small number of Senate Democrats and maybe independent Sanders, but he should get several Senate Republicans who aren’t up for reelection this year and in hiding from the tea party, the article asserted.

Health Care in America:   The United States spends more money on health care while getting less in return than all but two other nations in a new Bloomberg ranking of the most efficient countries for health care. Bloomberg ranked 48 countries on life expectancy and per capita health care costs. The U.S. ranked 46th. Only Serbia and Brazil were worse than the U.S. in the chart that highlights the tremendous gap between the soaring cost of medical treatment in the U.S. and its quality and effectiveness. Sen. Bernie Sanders favors a single-payer system that would cover everyone, cost less but get better results. He spoke out for such a Medicare-for-all health care system at a news conference last month on the anniversary of passage of Medicare.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Set for Limited Strike on Syria as British Vote No: President Obama is prepared to move ahead with a limited military strike on Syria, administration officials said Thursday, despite a stinging rejection of such action by Britain and mounting questions from Congress. The negative vote in Parliament was a heavy blow to Prime Minister David Cameron, who had pledged his support to Obama and called on lawmakers to endorse Britain’s involvement in a brief operation to punish the government of President Bashar al-Assad for apparently launching a deadly chemical weapons attack last week that killed hundreds, The New York Times reported.   Irene Recovery" The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide funding to replace much of a state office complex in Waterbury which was destroyed two years ago by Tropical Storm Irene. An agreement was reached with the Federal Emergency Management Agency that will provide nearly $90 million of the $125 million dollar price tag for the new complex. The Vermont project benefited from provisions in legislation passed after Hurricane Sandy. Sen. Patrick Leahy said he and Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch worked the halls of Congress to make it happen, the Burlington Free Press reported.   Fast-Food Strikes: Thousands of fast-food workers went on strike in over 60 cities Thursday to protest unfair wages, Politico reported.

Fast-Food Workers Protest:   There were nationwide protests on Thursday in more than 50 cities by low-paid workers at fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s. Many of the protesters are paid only the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. That amounts to about $15,000 a year for full-time employees, but many of the restaurant workers hold only part-time jobs. Sen. Bernie Sanders is a cosponsor of legislation to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, about what it would be if the minimum wage had kept up with inflation over the past 50 years. The minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009. After one-day strikes were staged earlier this summer, Sanders praised the workers “who are standing up for justice, who are putting a spotlight on one of the major economic crises facing this country.” While fast-food chains pay what Sanders called “starvation wages,” he noted that the top executives for the same firms are paid millions of dollars a year.

Employees of McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and others have pledged to walk off their jobs in 50 cities from Boston to Alameda, Calif., organizers say. They are expected to be joined by retail employees at stores owned by Macy's, Sears and Dollar Tree in some cities, Reuters reported.  King's Unrealized Economic Dream: Paying tribute to King's speech, President Barack Obama called on America to come together to address "the great unfinished business" of the original March on Washington – economic justice, CBS News reported. "The men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract idea," Mr. Obama said from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, where King stood 50 years before him. "They were there seeking jobs as well as justice. Not just the absence of oppression, but the presence of economic opportunity. For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he can't afford the meal?"   Decommissioning Vermont Yankee: A fight is brewing over the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant's lengthy decommissioning process. Entergy CEO Leo Denault said that if the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission agrees, the plant will be mothballed for up to 60 years while its radioactive components cool down before removal. Sen. Bernie Sanders was among those calling for the decommissioning process to commence as soon as possible, The Associated Press reported. In Seven Days, Sanders said the nuclear power plant’s closure will “allow Vermont to focus on … economical sources of sustainable and renewable energy.”   Employee Ownership: Sen. Sanders is one of the federal government's strongest proponents for employee ownership, according to a PBS “NewsHour” online report.

The share of people living alone, meanwhile, rose 10 percentage points, to 27 percent. The analysis also found that the recession profoundly affected American families from 2005 to 2011, resulting in a 15 percent decline in homeownership among households with children and a 33 percent increase in households where at least one parent was unemployed, The New York Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   College Costs Surge 538% Since 1985: College tuition costs have risen 538% since 1985, according to a Bloomberg report. Skyrocketing increases in college costs exacerbate income inequality by keeping those of less means from the schooling they need.   Debt Limit: The United States Treasury will hit its borrowing limit in mid-October, according to The Wall Street Journal. The timeframe is sooner than many on Capitol Hill had anticipated, meaning there will be extra pressure on Congress to raise the debt ceiling in the coming weeks.   NSA Spied on UN: The United States hacked into an internal United Nations video conferencing system in 2012, according to a Der Spiegel report citing National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden.  A UN spokesman told Reuters that well-established law prohibited such spying and that the organization would contact the United States.   Veterans Health Care: No government agency has calculated fully the lifetime cost of health care for post-9/11 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but it is certain to be high NBC News reported. “Medical costs peak decades later,” said Linda Bilmes, a Harvard University professor and coauthor of "The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict."

Must Read: Stagnant Wages Are Crimping Economic Growth - Neil Shah, The Wall Street Journal:   Americans are spending enough to keep the economy rolling, but don't expect them to splurge unless their paychecks start to grow. Four years into the economic recovery, U.S. workers' pay still isn't even keeping up with inflation. The average hourly pay for a nongovernment, non-supervisory worker, adjusted for price increases, declined to $8.77 last month from $8.85 at the end of the recession in June 2009, Labor Department data show.  Stagnant wages erode the spending power of consumers. That means it is harder for them to make purchases ranging from refrigerators to restaurant meals that account for most of the nation's economic growth.  Economists blame three factors:  Economic growth remains sluggish, advancing at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of less than 2% for three straight quarters—below the prerecession average of 3.5%. That effectively has put a lid on inflation, which has been near or below the 2% level the Federal Reserve considers healthy for the economy. With demand for labor low, prices not rising fast and 11.5 million unemployed searching for work, employers aren't under pressure to raise wages to retain or attract workers.  Businesses are changing how they manage payrolls. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in a recent paper said that, in the past, companies cut wages when the economy struggled and raised them amid expansions. But in the past three recessions since 1986—and especially the 2007-2009 downturn—companies minimized wage cuts and instead let workers go to keep remaining workers happy. As a result, to compensate for the wage cuts that never were made, businesses now may be capping wage growth. "As the economy recovers, pent-up wage cuts will probably continue to slow wage growth long after the unemployment rate has returned to more normal levels," the researchers said.

Washington has begun celebrating the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's landmark address, WNYT-TV in Albany, N.Y., reported on Monday.   Stagnant Wages Are Crimping Economic Growth: Americans are spending enough to keep the economy rolling, but don't expect them to splurge unless their paychecks start to grow.

NSA’s Critics in Congress: The latest disclosures over government surveillance programs have emboldened their critics on Capitol Hill, ensuring that the debate over national security and privacy will remain intense when Congress returns this fall. Lawmakers clamored for security officials to provide more information on the surveillance programs after a secret national-security court ruling released Wednesday concluded that some National Security Agency practices violated the Constitution, and new media reports detailed the NSA’s surveillance programs were broader than previously known, according to The Wall Street Journal.   Tar Sands Pipeline: The State Department's Office of Inspector General said Friday it will release the results of an investigation into a possible conflict of interest in the department's Keystone XL pipeline review in January—a move that could delay a final decision on the project until next year. The OIG is investigating allegations that a consulting firm hired to produce the draft environmental impact statement for the pipeline had ties to TransCanada Corp. and the American Petroleum Institute, both organizations with a key stake in the project, National Journal reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   March on Washington: Sen. Bernie Sanders was among the more than 200,000 people who gathered at the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Washington 50 years ago to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King deliver his "I Have a Dream" speech. Since then, Sanders said, there has been some real progress in breaking down barriers of discrimination and segregation, including the election and re-election of an African-American president. But Sanders said the country is worse off than it was in 1963 in unemployment, low wages and more wealth disparity, according to an Associated Press report in the Times Argus, Rutland Herald and Brattleboro Reformer. In the Valley News, Sanders said the anniversary is a time to reflect on progress that has occurred but also to realize that the country has a long way to go.   ‘I Have a Dream’: Sen. Sanders credits King with shaping the values he holds to this day, he told WPTZ-TV. He spoke about his experience at the march. “It was just a huge crowd of every kind of people – African- Americans, whites. There was a real sense of joy and optimism because the success had already occurred before King’s speech just by huge numbers who showed up. It was very positive day.” Fox 44 and ABC 22 aired video of Sanders at the Lincoln Memorial. “We have come a long, long way in a lot of areas in fulfilling some of the visions that this great man had. But on the other hand let us not forget for one second that a lot of his dreams still have not been fulfilled.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=2db914b7-4885-492a-8881-4392ca9f7b07

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The March on Washington … Sen. Bernie Sanders was a 22-year-old student at the University of Chicago in 1963, when he was among the thousands of people who took buses to Washington, D.C. for the March on Washington. “When a couple hundred thousand people descend on Washington, it has an impact in moving this country and the government to address a national disgrace, which was segregation,” he told the Burlington Free Press. “When large numbers of people stand together for justice, we can make real change.”   … For Jobs and Freedom As the anniversary of the March on Washington approached, Sen. Sanders returned to the Lincoln Memorial where hundreds of thousands of Americans gathered on August 28, 1963. Now the independent senator from Vermont, Sanders heard the Rev.

He was talking about economic justice,” Sanders recalled, according to John Nichols of The Nation.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   King's Dream: Sen. Bernie Sanders told Thom Hartmann Thursday that "as a nation, we have made some real progress" in realizing the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who gave his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech 50 years ago. But Sanders said the media often fails to mention that King was "not only a great leader in terms of opposing segregation." He was also a "valiant fighter for economic rights.”   Food Safety: Food and Drug Administration officials heard from hundreds of farmers from Vermont and New Hampshire during a listening session this week on new food safety rules under consideration by the federal agency. Efforts by the New England congressional delegation resulted in sessions in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Jenny Nelson, Sen. Sanders’ agriculture policy advisor, said the hearings have been an eye-opener for the FDA, WAMC-FM reported.   Solar City: Green Mountain Power unveiled energy projects that could make Rutland a national laboratory for innovation, as well as an exemplar in community betterment. “It is an ambitious and far-sighted vision that has been embraced by Mayor Christopher Louras and other city officials,” the Rutland Herald said in an editorial which also noted that Sen. Sanders was on hand to lend his support.   Global Warming: Scientists released a report this week that found — with 95 percent certainty — that human activity is raising temperatures and as a result of that sea levels may rise by more than three feet by the end of the century. Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer recently introduced legislation to tax carbon emissions and invest in clean energy technologies. “It launches the conversation where it should be launched: a punitive tax on the human behavior that is pushing the world’s environment toward calamity,” Angelo Lynn wrote in an Addison County Independent editorial.

Youth Unemployment:   On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that teenager’s work rates fell during the recession and have not been able to recover.  “A decade ago, a 16- or 17-year-old boy was twice as likely to have a job as his 70-year-old grandfather,” wrote Ben Casselman of The Wall Street Journal. “Today, the grandfather is actually more likely to have a job than the boy.”  As a part of Sen. Sanders’ effort to fight youth unemployment he has introduced legislation that would provide $1.5 billion over two years for states and local communities to help find jobs for more than 400,000 unemployed 16- to 24-year-olds. Currently, the official unemployment rate for that age group is 16.2 percent. Sanders’ legislation passed the Senate in June as a part of the immigration reform bill.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Solar City: Green Mountain Power plans to turn Rutland, Vt., into a national example of energy efficiency. The utility will put solar collectors on 40 street lights, develop an “energy park” and install quick-charge stations for electric cars as part of an ambitious “solar city” initiative. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the undertaking by Vermont’s largest utility will cut power bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. “I don’t think there is any private utility in the United States of America that had been as bold, as aggressive and as innovative as Green Mountain Power” Sanders said, according to the Rutland Herald.   Vermont Yankee: Sen. Sanders said he was disappointed by a federal appeals court ruling that rejected the state’s attempt to close the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, Vermont Public Radio reported on Wednesday. Sanders said Vermont should be able to close the plant on economic grounds. "We have a nuclear power plant which is antiquated, which is of the same design as the plant in Fukushima. I think there is a strong desire on the part of the people of the state of Vermont to shut that plant down. It was originally supposed to last for 40 years. And I think that’s what the people want."   Head Start Cuts: Federal budget cuts, known as the sequester, are decreasing the number of spaces in Head Start preschool programs around Vermont and the nation, the St. Albans Messenger reported. Sen. Sanders' office estimated that about 233 children in Vermont would be unable to participate in Head Start due to the cuts.   VA Claims Backlog: The Veterans Affairs Department says the number of backlogged compensation claims has shrunk by 20 percent since its March peak. Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders welcomed the news, Federal Computer Week reported. "I am pleased to see the VA making significant progress … but we must remain aggressive and we intend to closely monitor the situation to ensure that the progress continues … toward the goal of ending the backlog by the end of 2015."

The Solar Capital of New England:  On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders was joined by leaders from Green Mountain Power to celebrate the expansion of solar development in Rutland, Vt. The project would put Rutland on a path to generate 10 megawatts of solar power by the end of 2015, making it the highest per-capita of solar reliance of any city in New England.  “At a time when it is clear that global warming poses the greatest threat the planet has ever faced, I am very pleased that Green Mountain Power is making great strides in its effort to make Rutland, Vermont the solar capital of New England,” Sen. Sanders said.  “Their success in Rutland, working with local community partners, to dramatically expand solar energy in the city is extraordinary.  I applaud the outstanding work being done here, which shows the rest of the country that we can transform our energy system from foreign oil to sustainable energy.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=7C8D4528-B6B2-4532-8998-C27AE7457BB7

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   VA Backlog: The Department of Veterans Affairs is chipping away steadily at a disability claims backlog. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs Chairman Bernie Sanders said the latest figures show progress but "we must remain aggressive and we intend to closely monitor the situation to ensure that the progress continues," The Washington Post reported. Rep. Jeff Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said the decrease is "a welcomed statistic," but he questioned whether the progress will continue, according to the article also published by the Valley News.   Wall Street: "The center of establishment and big-money power is Wall Street," Sen. Sanders said on The Ed Show Tuesday. With assets equal to two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, Wall Street entities enjoy enormous political power in Washington. Sanders has proposed legislation to break up “too-big-to-ail” banks.   March on Washington: A young Bernie Sanders attended the March on Washington that featured Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream" speech. The future senator said King was just as interested in economic justice and wanted to end the Vietnam war, stands that turned much of the political establishment against King. “Sanders relates to that and credits King with shaping the values that have defined his own career,” WPTZ-TV reported.   Egypt: The White House disputed news reports citing Sen. Patrick Leahy’s claim that the U.S. has secretly suspend most forms of military aid to Egypt. Leahy argued for an aid cutoff after a military coup toppled the democratically-elected president. Sen. Sanders also criticized the coup by Egypt’s military but voiced concern that an aid cutoff could cost the U.S. leverage in its attempt to restore democracy, WCAX-TV reported.

Sanders Pushes for Wall Street Reforms:   As the United States nears the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis next month, Sen. Sanders addressed the need for regulators to implement Wall Street reforms.  In an interview on the Ed Schultz radio program, Sen. Sanders said “If we are ever going to be successful in rebuilding a collapsing middle class, and dealing with poverty, and creating the jobs that we desperately need in this country, you have to deal with Wall Street. You just can’t push it aside.” Sanders also told the audience that Wall Street banks “write two-thirds of the credit cards in America, half of the mortgages in America, 95 percent of the derivatives in America, and they play a huge role in the oil futures market and their speculation there drives up oil prices that the average driver sees at the gas pump.”   Listen to the radio interview » http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/media/listen/?m=4f9676d8-9448-4875-ad89-31f2734640a5

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans Health Care: Sen. Bernie Sanders urged veterans to take advantage of cutting-edge health care available from the Department of Veterans Affairs. "My message today is that for the men and women in the state of Vermont who have put their lives on the line to defend this country, we have some excellent facilities available for you," Sanders said at a news conference. He was joined by officials from the White River Junction VA hospital, The Associated Press and others reported.   Veterans Health Care: Sen. Sanders cited the use of telemedicine and the VA’s embrace of holistic and preventative approaches as well as a new women’s clinic at White River VA, Vermont Public Radio reported. The White River Junction medical center serves about 25,000 vets from Vermont and the four contiguous counties in New Hampshire, but the VA system in Vermont has the capacity to serve more eligible veterans across the state and parts of New Hampshire, WAMC-FM reported.    Vermont Veterans Home: Sen. Sanders on Monday welcomed good news from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that the Bennington facility passed a recent inspection. The state-run home had faced with an Aug. 26 deadline for the loss of federal funding after failing earlier CMS inspections, AP, the Burlington Free Press, Valley News and WPTZ-TV reported. The Rutland Herald and Times Argus said Sanders brought together Gov. Peter Shumlin’s administration with federal officials to preserve funding. The home’s president told the Bennington Banner that he shares Sanders’ goal to make the home the best in the nation.   Debit-Card Fees: United States District Court Judge Richard Leon tossed out a Federal Reserve rule governing debit-card fees last week after banks overcharged customers for fees, the Addison County Independent reported. The ruling was a stern criticism of the Federal Reserve board, forcing the Fed to rewrite the rule to limit 'interchange fees' to ensure they reflect actual costs. Sen. Sanders "continues to be one of the few who rails against such injustices, but he needs the public's continued support on these issues if his voice is resonate," Angelo Lynn wrote in an editorial.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans Health Care: Sen. Bernie Sanders will be discussing veterans' health care needs at a news conference in Burlington today. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, will be joined by the director and co-acting chief of staff of the VA Medical Center in White River Junction. Sanders' office says the VA now serves about 8,600 veterans at clinics in Colchester, Brattleboro, Rutland, Bennington and Newport, The Associated Press and WPTZ-TV reported.   Student Loans: “The massive earnings the government gets on student-loan programs amount to a crude backdoor tax increase disguised by cynical legislators (who hesitate to ask constituents with more powerful lobbies to help cut the deficit) as an investment in America's youth,” according to Rolling Stone. “It's basically a $185 billion tax hike on middle-income and low-income citizens and their families,” said Warren Gunnels, senior policy adviser for Sen. Sanders, one of the few legislators critical of the recent congressional student-loan compromise.   ‘I Have a Dream’: Reflecting Sunday on the upcoming 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Sen. Sanders said there have been “mixed results” in the decades since the historic march led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders. A 22-year-old college student in 1963, Sanders rode a bus to Washington, D.C, to participate in the march. There has been significant progress in the past half century “breaking down the barriers of discrimination and segregation,” Sanders said on MSNBC, but “in terms of economic justice, I would say that in many ways we are worse off.”   NSA Violations ‘Just the Tip of a Larger Iceberg,’ Say Wyden, Udall: Two Democratic senators say new reporting by The Washington Post about invasions of privacy by U.S. intelligence is ”just the tip of a larger iceberg.” The senators made that statement in response to a Post report outlining violations of privacy rules by the National Security Agency, according to Roll Call, after the Post published a copy of a top secret internal NSA audit report identifying thousands of “incidents” in which the NSA ran afoul of court orders and other rules governing intelligence collection.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Domestic Spying: The National Security Agency has overstepped its legal authority and violated the privacy of thousands of Americans, according to an audit cited in published reports. "We have to defend the American people from the very real threat of terrorism," Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Thom Hartmann on Friday, "but there are ways to do that without undermining basic privacy and constitutional rights."   Postal Service: A plan to allow the Postal Service to ship beer and wine could generate $50 million in revenue for the agency, according to FOX 44. Sen. Sanders supports the idea, but said the Postal Service’s larger fiscal issues are more deeply rooted in a burdensome congressional mandate that requires the agency to overpay a fund for future retiree benefits.  Student Loans: The Senate passed legislation that will provide relief on student loan interest rates “but it is far from perfect,” Sen. Carl Levin wrote in an op-ed published by the Hillsdale (Mich.) Daily News. “The student debt problem … requires a carefully … long-term solution … But this legislation is not it. That is why I supported an amendment … by Sens. Jack Reed and Elizabeth Warren and another by Sen. … Sanders that would have mitigated some of the long-term damage of this legislation.”  ‘I’ll Take Bernie’: “I will take independent Sen. Bernie Sanders any day,” a caller told C-SPAN during a Saturday morning call-in program that asked. “Who best represents your political party?” Maggie from Texas added that she prefers Sanders because “he is a man of principle. He stands up for the little people. He does not represent the 1 percent in this country. He represents the other 99%.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=2d7ec943-19cd-4ab3-ab94-21d4d9d82267
The Week in Review:  The National Security Agency has overstepped its legal authority, according to an audit cited in published reports on Friday. “We have got to do everything we can to combat terrorism and protect the American people,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on The Thom Hartmann Program, but he renewed his call for legislation to limit surveillance to cases when intelligence and law enforcement authorities have specific reasons to be suspicious of someone. Around the world, it was a week of bloodshed in Egypt as government security forces cracked down on demonstrations loyal to the elected leader deposed by the military. In this country, Sanders applauded students who gathered petitions from people all over Vermont supporting legislation to require labels on food made from genetically engineered ingredients. He pressed the case for modernizing the Postal Service instead of cutting services. And in a Monday op-ed written with Sen. Elizabeth Warren for The Huffington Post, Sanders and weighed into the debate over the Federal Reserve’s role in restoring full employment.

Sanders, Boxer Propose Climate Change Bills: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=2a869a44-1597-42a8-b625-1a88db3febbc
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   GMO Labeling: Vermont Public Interest Research Group on Thursday held a Statehouse rally to unveil some 30,000 signatures in support of labeling foods that contain genetically modified organisms. Sen. Bernie Sanders told the crowd it’s a matter of consumers having the right to know what’s in their food, WPTZ-TV, FOX44, ABC 22, Vermont Public Radio and vtdigger.org reported. Sanders tried unsuccessfully to push through a farm bill amendment that would have allowed states to approve such laws, the Brattleboro Reformer reported.   USPS: The Postal Service would have posted a profit for last quarter without the "unnecessary burden" imposed during the Bush administration that it must sock away more than $5 billion a year in a fund that already has enough set aside to pay for future retirees’ health care, Sen. Sanders told Ed Schultz on Thursday.   The Fed: “One reason passions run so strong about the next Fed chair is that this is more than a choice between Larry Summers and Janet Yellen. It's also a debate between the "Wall Street Wing of the Democratic Party" -- represented by Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, Timothy Geithner and Gene Sperling -- and the "Main Street Wing" of the party -- represented by Sherrod Brown, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,” Bill Press wrote in a syndicated column in the Anchorage Daily News.   NSA Routinely Broke Privacy Rules, Audit Finds: The National Security Agency has broken privacy rules or overstepped its legal authority thousands of times each year since Congress granted the agency broad new powers in 2008, according to an internal audit and other top-secret documents. Most of the infractions involve unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the United States, both of which are restricted by statute and executive order. Documents provided to The Washington Post by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden include details and analysis that is not routinely shared with Congress or the special court that oversees surveillance.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Social Security: Wednesday marked the 78th anniversary of the signing of the Social Security Act by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Since its inception, Social Security has changed society and drastically reduced senior poverty. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been "reliably the staunchest defender of Social Security in Congress," according to The Huffington Post.   Priority Mail: Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe announced Wednesday plans to revamp the United States Postal Service's priority mail in order to boost revenues, The Hill reported. A recent financial report said the agency had lost $3.9 billion so far this year. Sen. Sanders argued that the service would have posted a profit for the past three months without a requirement to deposit $5.5 billion a year into a retiree fund that already has more than enough to pay future health benefits.   Prison Transfers on Hold: Federal officials temporarily suspended a plan to turn the Danbury women's prison into a facility for men, The Associated Press reported. The move came after 11 senators from the Northeast, including Sen. Sanders, wrote the Bureau of Prisons to say that the transfers would leave the region with no federal prison beds for women. The senators said the move would unnecessarily disrupt the lives of inmates and their family members.   Domestic Surveillance: In the wake of Edward Snowden's National Security Agency leaks, lawmakers have proposed several bills aimed at curbing domestic surveillance programs, Truth-Out reported. One bill from Sen. Sanders would require the government to provide a special court "specific and articulable facts" supporting each surveillance order. The bill also would limit the purposes of surveillance to specific FBI investigations of international terrorism.

‘A Remarkable Success Story’:   President Franklin Roosevelt signed Social Security into law on August 14, 1935. “Since its inception 78 years ago, through good economic times and bad, Social Security has paid out every penny owed to every eligible beneficiary. This is a remarkable success story," said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the head of the Senate’s Defending Social Security Caucus. Unfortunately, senior White House aides this summer reportedly have held secret meetings with Senate Republicans to revive President Obama’s proposal to cut future benefits for retirees, disabled veterans and others. That, Sanders said, would be “a huge mistake.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=95DD4692-0E66-4418-8517-5C22AED905B5
The next Fed chair will have an opportunity to get our economy back on track and to help rebuild America's middle class. But that will require the right temperament and a willingness to take on Wall Street CEOs when necessary. It is critical that the next Fed chair make a genuine, long-term commitment to supporting those who don't have armies of lobbyists and lawyers to advance their interests in Washington -- working and middle-class families.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The Fed: “The next Fed chair will have enormous power and influence over our entire financial system and the direction of the economy … The president's nominee … must be committed to improving the lives of working Americans who are still struggling through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,” Sens. Sanders and Warren wrote in a column posted on OpEdNews. On the Seeking Alpha website, a financial services advisor responded to questions for the Fed nominee that were posed by Sanders and Warren.  The Fed: “This is really a battle inside the Democratic Party,” Bill Press said on Current TV of a debate over who should replace Ben Bernanke as the head of the central bank. “It's the Wall Street wing of the party versus the consumer wing of the party, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders on that side and then over here you have Chuck Schumer.” Bob Cusack, managing editor of The Hill, agreed. “I think that's a very accurate read and the problem for the White House is the left is not going to be happy and Bernie Sanders is not going to go mute if [Lawrence] Summers is appointed.”  F-35s: Opponents of a plan to base the Air Force's F-35 fighter planes at the Burlington International Airport spoke during a public comments period at this week's Burlington City Council meeting. Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger, as well as Gov. Peter Shumlin, Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch, have said the plane is important to the state’s economy, according to an Associated Press report in the Rutland Herald.

‘No One Should be Living Like This’:   Seven students and a teacher from Mt. Mansfield Union High School in Jericho, Vt., leave Saturday for a trip to one of the poorest counties in the United States. Their goal is to help the Oglala Lakota Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.  Working with a non-profit organization, the Vermont students will spend several days learning about the history and people of the South Dakota Black Hills. Senior Ana Wright said she wanted to make the trip because these families “are living in terrible conditions.” “We should definitely help them because no one should be living like this,” she said.   Sen. Bernie Sanders praised the students for their willingness to confront such challenges.

Congress Must Not Hobble Postal Service Rebound:   With revenue rebounding, the U.S. Postal Service would have posted a profit for the past three months without an unprecedented requirement that it sink $5.5 billion a year into future retiree health care, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said today.   The latest quarterly report on Postal Service finances showed a $740 million loss, but all of that red ink would have been eliminated and a $660 million profit would have been posted had the Postal Service not been forced to sink money into a system that already has set aside enough to meet the health care needs of retirees for decades to come.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  USPS: Sen. Bernie Sanders argued Monday that the Postal Service would have posted a profit for the past three months without the requirement to deposit $5.5 billion a year into the retiree fund, The Hill, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported. "The Postal Service has experienced financial problems and changes need to be made to bring it into the 21st century, but I am convinced that proposals to slow down mail delivery and provide less service are the wrong way to go," Sanders said. Counting the contribution to the already-flush retirement fund, the Postal Service reported a net loss of $740 million in the quarter which ended June 30.   The Fed: Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want potential candidates for the Federal Reserve Board to address whether the Fed's top priority is meeting its full-employment mandate, American Banker reported. The two senators are “making the right demands and asking the right questions,” John Nichols wrote for The Nation. The senators are considered two of the most aggressive critics of Wall Street’s influence in the federal government, according to The Washington Examiner. It called their column “an implicit rebuke to [Lawrence] Summers, who many liberals believe helped generate the financial crisis by pushing for deregulatory measures as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary in the late 1990s and early 2000s.”   The Fed: “The next Fed chair will have an opportunity to get our economy back on track and to help rebuild America’s middle class. But that will require the right temperament and a willingness to take on Wall Street CEOs when necessary.  It is critical that the next Fed chair make a genuine, long-term commitment to supporting those who don’t have armies of lobbyists and lawyers to advance their interests in Washington – working and middle-class families,” Sens. Sanders and Warren wrote in their column posted on TruthDig, Daily Kos, MichaelMoore.com, Reader Supported News and Green Mountain Daily.   Irene Recovery: Moretown has been awarded $700,000 in federal funds to build a new municipal building to replace the old one that was damaged in Tropical Storm Irene, Vermont Business Journal reported online.

Four Questions for Fed Chair Candidates:   As President Obama weighs a replacement for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren said the next central banker must address whether the Fed’s top priority is meeting its full-employment mandate, whether to break up “too-big-to-fail” banks, whether the deregulation of Wall Street contributed to the recession and whether $2 trillion that financial institutions have parked at the Fed should be used to help small- and medium-size businesses create jobs.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   The Fed: As President Obama weighs a replacement  for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke after his term runs out on Jan. 31, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren said the next central banker must address whether the Fed’s top priority is meeting its full-employment mandate, whether to break up “too-big-to-fail” banks, whether the deregulation of Wall Street contributed to the recession and say what should be done with $2 trillion that financial institutions have parked at the Fed. Writing in The Huffington Post, Sanders and Warren proposed using those resources to help small- and medium-sized businesses create jobs.    Disaster Aid: Emergency management officials will hold public meetings this month for Vermont communities that are eligible for federal reimbursement to cover damage from this summer’s rain and flooding. Communities in Caledonia, Chittenden, Orange, Orleans, Rutland, Washington and Windsor counties can submit reimbursement requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover 75 percent of the costs of damage to roads and infrastructure from rain and flooding from June 25 to July 11, The Associated Press reported.   Team Rubicon: This past weekend, 23 members of Team Rubicon responded to locations in East Wallingford, Mount Holly and Shrewsbury to clear away wreckage that still remained nearly two years after Tropical Strom Irene. Formed in 2010 to respond to the earthquake in Haiti, the ranks of Team Rubicon — which includes veterans from the U.S. Army, Marines, Navy and Coast Guard — have grown from six members to more than 10,000, all with the mission to provide disaster relief and perform community service, the Rutland Herald reported.   Embassies Open: American diplomatic outposts reopened throughout the Middle East on Sunday, easing the sense of imminent danger that has preoccupied the Obama administration since it learned of a possible terrorist attack from communications between two high-ranking officials of Al Qaeda two weeks ago. But the one embassy that remained closed — in Sana, the capital of Yemen — underscored the challenges President Obama faces in trying to wind down the nation’s decade-long campaign against Al Qaeda and its affiliates, The New York Times reported.

Four Questions for Fed Chair Candidates - Sen. Bernie Sanders and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren  The decisions made by the next chair of the Federal Reserve will have a powerful impact on the economic well-being of every person in America.  While the largest financial institutions and corporations in this country have been bailed out and are now back to making enormous profits and rewarding their executives with outsized compensation packages, recovery hasn't gone so well for the rest of America. Middle class families have continued to lose ground economically, the number of Americans living in poverty is near an all-time high, and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider.  The next Fed chair will have enormous power and influence over our entire financial system and the direction of the economy. The Fed is responsible not only for our country's monetary policy, but it is also a key regulator of financial institutions. In our view, the president's nominee for Fed chair must be committed to improving the lives of working Americans who are still struggling through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  To that end, we think any Fed chair nominee should be able to answer the following four questions:  Continue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/four-questions-for-fed-ch_b_3740369.html

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama on VA Claims Backlog: President Obama, addressing the annual convention of the Disabled American Veterans on Saturday, said his administration is making progress on reducing a backlog of disability claims that shrank by nearly one-fifth since peaking at more than 600,000 just a few months ago. CNN reported that the backlog built up as new waves of claims were coming in. The VA completed more than 1 million claims each of the last three years, according to Sen. Bernard Sanders, the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.  Local Legends: Sen. Sanders, Vermont’s first woman governor, Madeleine Kunin, Phish members and Ben & Jerry of ice cream fame are among an eclectic crowd of people featured in a new book, “Legendary Locals of Burlington” by Robert Resnik, himself something of a local legend, according to a Burlington Free Press book review.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Vermont Veterans Home: Sen. Bernard Sanders brought officials together with employees of the Vermont Veterans Home in the office of Gov. Peter Shumlin to keep the home from losing state and federal funding after federal inspectors found deficiencies at the home. David Weinstein, a senior policy adviser for Sanders, said the senator and Jeb Spaulding, the secretary of the Agency of Administration, led the meeting to look for ways to keep the home running without losing its primary source of funding, the Rutland Herald reported.  Diplomatic Missions Reopen: Eighteen of the 19 U.S. embassies and consulates that were closed in the Middle East and Africa because of a terrorist threat will reopen Sunday, the State Department said. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen will remain closed. The consulate in Lahore, Pakistan, which was closed Thursday because of what officials say was a separate credible threat, also was not scheduled to reopen, The Associated Press reported.

The Week in Review:   President Obama on Friday signed legislation that the White House disingenuously ballyhooed as providing big savings for students. The law sets rates right away that are greater than they were for the past two years. What’s worse is that the cost of borrowing for college is project to nearly double within five years. Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against the bill. Last year was among the 10 warmest on record, according to a report issued Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report also said there were record greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. Sanders on Wednesday praised Postal Service unions for putting up a fight against proposals in Congress that would cut service and cut jobs.  Sanders also took on a growing movement among congressional Republicans to abolish the minimum wage. The Voting Rights Act, signed 48 years ago last Tuesday, is now in jeopardy because of a June Supreme Court ruling that already being used by states to make it harder for minorities to vote.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Military Sexual Assaults: President Barack Obama hasn’t formally met with senators who’ve made the issue of sexual assault in the military a priority. He hasn’t endorsed any of their proposals and top aides have made no commitment to lawmakers and victims groups. In an op-ed in The Hill, former Clinton White House lawyer Lanny Davis asked why Obama was missing in action on a proposal supported by Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, Politico reported. “This purple moment when Paul and Sanders agree on something doesn’t happen very often,” Davis wrote.   USPS: Sen. Tom Carper has proposed legislation that would allow the post office to eliminate Saturday service in a year and reduce the number of mail-processing centers in two years. The American Postal Workers Union has taken to the airwaves, with an ad urging Congress not to cut employees but to change the way the Postal Service funds retirees’ health care. The union supports a bill sponsored by Sen. Sanders that would end the post office's prefunding requirement, National Public Radio reported on “All Things Considered.”   Veterans Home: An independent report on the Vermont Veterans Home in Bennington called the only state-run nursing home for veterans “fundamentally a good home,” but found “perceived weakness or incompetence” by administrators and cited distrust and a lack of communication with the staff. The home could lose federal Medicare and Medicaid payments on Aug. 26 unless it corrects deficiencies uncovered in a separate inspection by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Administration Secretary Jeb Spaulding told state lawmakers that Sen. Sanders and a representative from CMS met Thursday morning in Montpelier, the Rutland Herald reported.

Fast-Food Fight:   One-day strikes by fast-food workers this summer have highlighted the need to raise the minimum wage, which has been $7.25 since 2007. A Thursday editorial in The New York Times called the protests “a just cause.” Sen. Bernie Sanders also has congratulated the workers for speaking out against “starvation wages.” He is a cosponsor of legislation to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, about what it would be if the minimum wage had kept up with inflation over the past 50 years. The effort to pass that legislation is running up against those in Congress who don’t just oppose raising the minimum wage. “This will shock you but this is the truth,” Sanders said. “They want to abolish the minimum wage.” During a recent Senate labor committee hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander told Sanders he favors doing away with the minimum wage. He’s not alone. "I don’t think a minimum wage law works," Sen. Marco Rubio told CBS News earlier this year. Remarkably, 28 Republican senators went on record in 2007 and voted to abolish the minimum wage. Republican Party platforms in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Wyoming, and Oregon call for the minimum wage to be abolished.  Sanders “If we’re going to grow the middle class and one way to do that is to raise the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1C14BB88-5D19-4803-9D4E-7D72B583D754
Must Read: Most 2013 job growth is in part-time work, survey suggests - Kevin Hall, McClatchyDC:   WASHINGTON — The July government employment report released Friday showed the job market treading water.  And a closer look at one of the two measures the Labor Department uses to gauge employment suggests that part-time work accounted for almost all the job growth that’s been reported over the past six months.  Employers added a weaker-than-expected 162,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July, according to the Establishment Data Survey, which relies on reporting by a large sample of businesses.  The unemployment rate is measured by the separate Household Survey, and it fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 7.4 percent, its lowest level since December 2008. That’s due in part to slow growth in the labor force. The jobless rate is based on a sample of self-reporting from ordinary people across the nation, and it’s the Labor Department measure that shows a very troubling trend in hiring.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  USPS: Sen. Bernie Sanders Wednesday came out in support of Postal Service unions that oppose legislation likely to end Saturday mail, significantly slow delivery, close processing plants and eliminate door-to-door deliveries.  A bill by Sens. Tom Carper and Tom Coburn was called “‘a serious threat’ to the Postal Service in a joint letter signed by leaders of four labor organizations. Sanders questioned why the Carper-Coburn proposal retreats from most of the items agreed upon last year by 62 senators. “We also wonder what’s to gain from this backpedalling,” the Brattleboro Reformer said in an editorial.   Domestic Surveillance: When the House recently considered an amendment that would have dismantled the NSA’s bulk phone records collection program, the White House swiftly condemned the measure. But only five years ago, Sen. Barack Obama was part of a group of legislators that supported substantial changes to NSA surveillance programs. The 2007 measure Obama surrported is also similar to current proposals introduced by Rep. John Conyers and Sen. Sanders, according to a Probublica report in The Atlantic and Salon online and in the Philadelphia Daily News.   Medicare for All: Public Citizen sponsored a congressional briefing and press conference with last Wednesday Sen. Sanders and Reps. Conyers, Mark Takano and Keith Ellison to advocate single-payer health insurance for all Americans. President Obama should meet with progressives before negotiating on policy issues when Congress gets back from its August break, Pearl Korn wrote for The Huffington Post that.   VA Cybersecurity: The Veterans Affairs Department has done little over the last two months to satisfy House lawmakers' concerns about the security of the data of more than 20 million veterans. The House committee's frustration with VA's answers boiled over at a July 12 briefing with House and Senate committee staff members. A spokesman for the Senate committee said aides to Sens. Sanders and Richard Burr are concerned about the issue, Federal News Radio on WTOP-AM in Washington, D.C., reported.

A Death Spiral:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday agreed with unions representing Postal Service workers opposed to legislation likely to end Saturday mail service, significantly slow down delivery, close processing plants and eliminate door-to-door deliveries. A bill by Sens. Tom Carper and Tom Coburn was called “a serious threat” to the Postal Service in a joint letter signed by leaders of the American Postal Workers Union, National Association of Letter Carriers, National Postal Mail Handlers Union and the National Rural Letter Carriers Association.  The labor leaders said the Carper-Coburn legislation would dismantle mail processing and delivery networks, slash 80,000 jobs and retain elements of an onerous congressional mandate to pre-fund health benefits for future retirees. That mandate makes the Postal Service set aside $5.5 billion a year in a fund that already has more than enough to cover future benefits. Financing that mandate, which is unlike any in private business or other public-sector employers, accounts for about $4 out of every $5 in Postal Service debts.

Global Warming:   Last year was among the 10 warmest on record, according to a report issued Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report also said there were record greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. The biggest changes in the climate last year were recorded in the Arctic and in Greenland.  The Arctic warmed at about twice the rate of lower altitudes and lost record amounts of sea ice. “The findings are striking,” Kathryn Sullivan, NOAA’s acting administrator, told reporters on a conference call. To Sen. Bernie Sanders, the report is only the latest evidence that bold action is needed. “Our planet as a whole is becoming a warmer place. Global warming is the most serious environmental crisis facing the world today. It demands bold action to preserve our planet for our children and grandchildren.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=16098291-AC96-4178-AA94-1FCD736A49CD
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  USPS: The presidents of four unions sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday expressing "utter dismay" with a bill by Sens. Tom Carper and Tom Coburn that could end Saturday mail and door-to-door delivery. Another proposal circulating in both chambers addresses most of the unions' concerns, protecting Saturday delivery and ending a congressional mandate that requires the Postal Service to prefund retiree benefits. Sen. Bernard Sanders’ legislation has no Republican backing, The Washington Post reported. A matching bill by Rep. Peter A. DeFazio has seven GOP co-sponsors.  Road Repairs: Vermont's congressional delegation announced Tuesday that the state would receive more than $3.2 million from the United States Department of Transportation to help repair highways damaged by severe storms this spring and summer, according to an Associated Press report in the Burlington Free Press, Rutland Herald and elsewhere Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch said the money is in addition to a $1 million federal emergency grant announced earlier this summer.  Irene Recovery: During a town meeting with Gov. Peter Shumlin, Bennington Select Board Chairman Joseph Krawczyk Jr. inquired about progress in seeking Federal Emergency Management Administration funds to pay for emergency response work after Tropical Storm Irene. Shumlin said his administration, and the state’s congressional delegation, continue to seek a full reimbursement for Bennington. “You’ve made the right decision to go in and do the work you did, and FEMA should be fully reimbursing the town for that work. I agree with you on that. I know Leahy, Bernie and Welch agree with us on that,” he said in the Bennington Banner.  August Recess: Congress is taking its annual month-long break after an active several months for Vermont's congressional delegation, Vt. Digger reported. Sen. Sanders recently opposed the student loan rate deal, supported a $1.5 billion youth jobs program in the immigration reform package, and shepherded several pieces of legislation through the Veterans' Affairs Committee.

Voting Rights:   Tuesday marked the 48th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act. He said at the time it was "as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any battlefield." Now, the landmark law, which protected voters from discrimination for decades, is in jeopardy. The Supreme Court on June 25 invalidated a key portion of the act which prohibited states and localities with histories of racial discrimination from altering voting laws without federal approval. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the court's decision "turned back the clock on equality in America."

Starvation Wages for Fast-Food Workers: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=a877ce26-ca9a-4153-acc1-db0ea3b33f4b
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Starvation Wages: Responding to Sen. Sanders’ assertion that taxpayers subsidize Wal-Mart with Medicaid and food stamps for its underpaid workers, a spokesperson for the discount store told The Huffington Post that only 5 percent of its employees said in a 2005 survey that they used Medicaid. An internal memo from a Wal-Mart VP that same year, however, informed the board of directors that 46 percent of the children of Wal-Mart's 1.3 million U.S. employees were uninsured or on Medicaid.   USPS: Sen. Sanders is speaking out against a Postal Service bill that could end Saturday mail and door-to-door deliveries for homes and businesses. The measure introduced by Sens. Tom Carper and Tom Coburn, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is weaker than a bill that the Senate passed last year. Sanders is the sponsor of a competing measure with 28 cosponsors. He maintains that his alternative would save more Postal Service jobs, WTOP-AM news radio in Washington, D.C. reported on Monday.   Prison Transfer: Eleven New England senators, including Sanders, objected to plans to turn a women's prison in Danbury, Conn. into a facility for men, according to an Associated Press report in the Time Argus, Rutland Herald and Brattleboro Reformer. In a letter to the director of the federal Bureau of Prisons, the senators said the plan would leave the region without any prison spaces for females, creating unnecessary hardship for inmates' families.   Student Loans: As a member of the Senate education committee, Sen. Sanders cited Congressional Budget Office projections that interest rates would hit 7.25 percent for undergraduate loans in five years under a bill awaiting President Obama’s approval. By 2018, graduate loans would go up to 8.8 percent and parents would be charged 9.8 percent on loans for their children to attend college, according to the analysis by the non-partisan agency that provides economic data for Congress. “The delegation is correct to give fail marks to this plan,” the Rutland Herald said in an editorial.

Wal-Mart on Wal-Mart:  A Wal-Mart spokesman on Monday told The Huffington Post that only 5 percent of the discount chain’s workers were on Medicaid. The spokesman was attempting to rebut Sen. Bernie Sanders’ assertion on MSNBC that the Walton family, the Wal-Mart owners, got to be the richest family in American by paying workers so poorly that they need Medicaid and food stamps to survive. What the spokesman may have forgotten to mention was that an internal memo to  Wal-Mart’s board of directors (obtained by The New York Times) acknowledged that 46 percent of the children of Wal-Mart's 1.33 million U.S. employees were uninsured or on Medicaid. The 2005 memo by M. Susan Chambers, Wal-Mart's executive vice president for benefits, had more to say about how the company treats its workers:  - Wal-Mart's workers are getting sicker than the national population with preventable diseases such as obesity (p. 4). More than half of Wal-Mart's workers (p. 8) are not covered by its health insurance plans, meaning many do not have access to necessary preventative care and doctors' visits. "Our workers are getting sicker than the national population, particularly with obesity-related diseases".  - Wal-Mart's workers aren't using primary care because so many of them lack coverage. Instead, they opt to use taxpayer-subsidized emergency rooms. The Wal-Mart workforce "tends to over utilize emergency room and hospital services and underutilize prescriptions and doctor visits".

We Deliver for You?  Saturday mail would end under a new proposal introduced in the Senate. Door-to-door delivery for new customers also would stop. The Postal Service would be required to push homeowners and renters to voluntarily switch to curbside and cluster box delivery under the legislation filed by Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Carper and the panel's ranking Republican, Tom Coburn. “While I have a great deal of respect for Sens. Carper and Coburn, the Postal Service bill that they introduced is significantly weaker than the bill that passed the Senate last year with 62 votes. That makes no sense,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Fast Food Workers: Sen. Bernard Sanders is praising the thousands of fast-food workers around the country who staged one-day strikes last week to protest low wages. St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit were among the cities that saw pickets by workers at McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Popeye’s and Long John Silver’s restaurants as part of a campaign to double their hourly wages to $15 an hour. Sanders wants to raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from $7.25, where it’s been since 2009, The Associated Press, Burlington Free Press, Rutland Herald, Times Argus, Bennington Banner, Brattleboro Reformer, and WCAX-TV reported.  Republicans Want to End Minimum Wage: Sen. Sanders is talking about something that few other politicians will mention. Republicans aren’t just opposed to the minimum wage. They want to abolish it. In June, during a committee hearing, he got Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander to admit that he supports abolishing the minimum wage … While Republicans are plotting to abolish it, 71 percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage, Jason Easley wrote for Politicus.  Democrats Tack Left on Economy: Two major economic factors have fueled a return of populism. For starters, the recovery from the 2008 financial meltdown has been uneven. From 2009 to 2011, the wealthiest 1 percent saw their incomes grow by 11.2 percent, while incomes shrunk by 0.4 percent for the other 99 percent of the country. Second, deficit pressures have been temporarily relieved. “We have cut the deficit in half,” Sen. Sanders told the Fiscal Times. “Put that on the front pages of the paper. That’s not insignificant ... We’ve made good success. We’ve got to continue doing it. But now the focus has to be creating millions of jobs.”  Korean War: A memorial made of Vermont granite was unveiled Saturday in Manchester to remember 92 Vermonters killed in action and another 20 still missing in Korea 60 years after the war ended, the Rutland Herald reported. Sam Haskins, the veterans advocate for Sen. Sanders, read a letter from the senator after sharing some memories of his brother, Howard Haskins, a Korean War veteran. “We have a duty to ensure the sacrifices of these service members are never forgotten,” the letter said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Minimum Wage: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday said that the overwhelming majority of Americans believes that the current minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is “obscene.” He told Ed Schultz on MSNBC that the minimum wage should be raised to at least $10.10 an hour. He also praised fast-food workers in cities across the United States who staged one-day strikes to protest “starvation wages” at McDonalds, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and other restaurant chains. “We have to create millions of new jobs” to help the economy, he said, “but we also have to make the minimum wage a living wage.”  Civic Lesson for Vermont Teens: Four Vermont teens – David Koonz, Taylor Marquis, Caroline Braun and Marissa Farbman – represented Vermont at the American Legion-sponsored Boys Nation and Girls Nation conference in Washington, D.C. Koonz compared Sanders to a college professor as the senator grilled the students on the bills they had proposed, debating their potential advantages and drawbacks. “He was one of those guys you could sit in a room and talk with for hours on end,” Koonz told the Times Argus.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   USPS: Saturday mail service could be ended and door-to-door delivery eliminated under legislation introduced this week by Sens. Tom Carper and Tom Coburn. Sen. Bernie Sanders has introduced his own postal reform legislation with 30 cosponsors. He said he is “strongly opposed” to the Carper-Coburn proposal that is significantly weaker than a bill the Senate passed last year with 62 votes. “That makes no sense,” he said. "While we all understand that the Postal Service is experiencing financial problems today and that changes need to be made, providing fewer services and poorer quality is not the way to save the Postal Service,” Sanders said in The Hill.  House Votes to Ban Carbon Tax: House Republicans, with help from 12 Democrats, passed an amendment on Friday to ban a carbon tax, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. In the Senate, Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer have introduced a bill that would impose a fee on carbon pollution. Under the House-passed amendment, federal agencies would not be allowed to introduce carbon tax rules.  Shady Lenders: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the past year fielded 4,516 complaints from military families alleging violations by lenders of a federal law that protects service members with home mortgages, credit card and other debts, according to testimony before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. Sen. Sanders, the committee chairman, said the nation must "prepare for future" with tens of thousands of service members transitioning back to civilian life, San Diego Source reported.

The Week in Review:   The unemployment rate ticked down to 7.4 percent in July but real unemployment last month was 14 percent, according to a Labor Department survey released on Friday. The 14 percent figure factors in those who have given up looking for work and those forced to settle for part-time jobs. Thousands of fast-food workers have been holding one-day strikes to demand higher wages, a movement that Sen. Bernie Sanders applauded in a Senate floor speech on Thursday. On the health care front, Sanders on Wednesday renewed a push for a single-payer system that costs less but gets better results. And on Tuesday he joined Veterans Administration officials at an exhibit of cutting-edge technology that is improving patient care and cutting costs.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Unemployment: Employers added 162,000 jobs in July when the official unemployment rate ticked down to 7.4 percent. Real unemployment, according to the Labor Department, stood at 14 percent in July. That figure factors in those who have given up looking for work and those forced to settle for part-time jobs. It was the 34th straight month of employment gains but at a pace so slow it would take about seven years to close the so-called jobs gap created by the recession. “While we have, of course, made progress in the last five years since the Wall Street fiasco and losing 700,000 jobs a month, real unemployment today remains at 14 percent,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. “So anybody who thinks we’re at a good place in terms of employment is wrong,” he said on The Thom Hartmann Program.   Fast Food Workers: Sen. Sanders on Thursday congratulated thousands of fast-food workers who have staged one-day strikes in cities around the country to demand higher wages. “What they are saying loudly and clearly is that they cannot make it on $7.25 or $8 an hour, which is what many of them are being paid. I salute the courage of those young workers to stand up for themselves and millions of other low-wage workers.” He said the minimum wage should be raised to at least $10.10 an hour  which would increase wages for 30 million workers. Most are working people trying desperately to keep their families together,” Sanders told Thom Hartmann.   Taking on Wall Street: A group Sen. Paul Wellstone dubbed "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party" is beginning to challenge the "Wall Street wing" of the party, Robert L. Borosage blogged for Reuters. Sen. Sanders and others are leading the opposition to the administration's corporate trade policies.   The Fed: During the financial crisis, a view emerged that the Federal Reserve was far too concerned with the interests of bankers on Wall Street, and not enough with those of the unemployed on Main Street. Sen. Bernie Sanders has led the effort to reform the system in a way that removes the influence of bankers on the monetary policy committee, in particular by proposing a change in the way Fed reserve bank presidents are chosen. He has recently made noises suggesting that effort is far from over, CBS News Money Watch reported online.

Starvation Wages for Fast Food Workers:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday congratulated thousands of fast-food workers who have staged one-day strikes to demand higher wages. “I rise today to congratulate hundreds and hundreds of young people throughout the country who are standing up for justice, who are putting a spotlight on one of the major economic crises facing this country,” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech.  On Wednesday alone workers in St. Louis, Kansas City and Detroit picketed McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Popeye’s and Long John Silver’s restaurants as part of a campaign to double their hourly wages to $15 an hour. There also have been demonstrations in New York, N.Y., Chicago and Washington, D.C.  “What they are saying is workers cannot make it on $7.25 an hour, $7.50 an hour. Often they are unable to get 40 hours of work and in most cases they get no or very limited benefits,” Sanders added. “What they are saying is we need to raise the minimum wage in this country.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=4F856EEC-2FE3-4957-890A-836094A3E3C3

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   The Fed: President Obama on Wednesday tried to beat back criticism of Lawrence Summers from congressional Democrats who don't want to see him get the top job at the Federal Reserve. Summers served as treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and his performance in that role drew criticism from liberals who remain unhappy with his push to deregulate financial markets. “It would be a tragic mistake to nominate anyone as chair of the Fed who continued those failed policies," Sen. Sanders told The Associated Press. Sanders suggested a pair of dark-horse contenders. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich “may not be at the top of the White House list, but they should be,” John Nichols blogged for The Nation.   Shady Lenders: Despite improvements in enforcement of consumer protection laws, problems persist with loans, veterans’ benefits and retired pay and pensions, witnesses said at a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Chairman Sanders said his goal is to improve protections and to press the federal government to for “aggressive enforcement,” Military Times and Financial Advisor reported. In the last six months, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has received 1,939 complaints related to the financial protections, said Holly Petraeus of the bureau’s office of service member affairs.   VA Health Care: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders attended a demonstration of new technology that lets isolated veterans connect to doctors and other health care providers from home for problems ranging from depression to diabetes. Sanders praised the VA for what he called an extremely good job taking advantage of modern technology, WTOP-AM news radio reported. The VA is doing “cutting-edge work” in telehealth “which the rest of the medical community around the country I think is going to learn from,” Sanders said in a Military Times report. Sanders pointed out the advantages for veterans living in rural states like Vermont, the Rutland Herald reported.   Tax Reform: The Senate's top tax writers are not getting a lot of help rewriting the tax code from scratch. Many senators submitted vague proposals or ignored it altogether. Some did offer detailed proposals. Sen. Sanders highlighted his bills that would raise taxes on capital gains and dividends, create a Wall Street "speculation fee" and rescind oil and gas breaks. Among those declining comment were Sens. Chuck Schumer, Patrick Leahy and Tom Carper, Politico reported.

Medicare for All:   On today’s 48th anniversary of the law that created Medicare, Sen. Bernie Sanders joined a coalition advocating a Medicare-for-all health care system to provide better care at less cost.  Sanders spoke at a news conference with Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) and other supporters of a single-payer health care system.   “It is long past time that we recognize health care is a right, not a privilege,” Sanders said. “I am proud that Vermont is leading the nation in working to establish a single-payer system to provide better care at less cost.”  Watch Sen. Sanders' speech here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nRF9LaVaLs&feature=share&list=UUD_DaKNac0Ta-2PeHuoQ1uA
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Raise the Minimum Wage: Sen. Bernie Sanders argued Tuesday on CNN that it was wrong for companies like Wal-Mart to pay employees a “starvation wage” with no benefits so the workers must rely on taxpayer-funded programs like Medicaid and food stamps, Raw Story blogged. “I’m proposing that the wealthiest family in this country, the Walton family that owns Wal-Mart, not be subsidized by the middle class in this country,” Sanders said. “They’ve got to start paying their workers a living wage, not starvation wages, provide health care to their workers, not enable them to go on Medicaid.”   Obama on Capitol Hill: President Obama on Wednesday will head to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate Democrats to strategize about their agenda. Sen. Sanders told The Wall Street Journal that Obama is "not a fighter," according to MSNBC's Richard Lui.   VA Health Care: VA health leaders showed off a wide range of remote medical offerings Tuesday at an event designed to tout the department’s place as a leader in cutting-edge health care delivery. Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, praised the VA as a model for health systems throughout the country, Stars and Stripes and WPTZ-TV eported. The new technology “significantly improves access to health care,” said Sanders in the Valley News. “It is especially important in rural America in states like Vermont.”   Tax Reform: The topic was suddenly at the center of the Washington debate on Tuesday when President Obama traveled to Chattanooga, Tenn., to promote his own ideas for a business-only tax overhaul. Obama's proposal clashed with ideas offered by the House and Senate tax committee chairmen who solicited ideas from members. Sen. Sanders, for example, suggested imposing a 0.03 percent tax on the sale of financial instruments like credit default swaps, derivatives, stock options and futures, as well as a tax on carbon and methane emissions and higher capital-gains and dividend tax rates for affluent investors, The New York Times reported.

Wal-Mart Welfare:   Who opposes raising the minimum wage? Wal-Mart. The discount chain made the Walton family the richest in American by paying workers so little they need food stamps to feed their families and Medicaid to pay their doctor bills. In an interview on Tuesday with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, Sen. Bernie Sanders made the case for raising the minimum wage to help workers at Wal-Mart and other employers that now pay starvation wages. A side benefit, Sanders added, would be that taxpayers wouldn’t have to subsidize the Waltons.  Watch the interview here: http://youtu.be/eYFueqv0iIQ
Cutting Edge Healthcare for Veterans:   Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Bernie Sanders today joined the Department of Veterans Affairs at an exhibit of cutting-edge medical technology that is improving treatment and expanding access to care for million veterans throughout the country.  Dr. Robert Petzel, VA’s undersecretary for health, said VA medical centers are in the forefront of what he predicted will be an “explosion” in computer and communications technology that lets patients and doctors interact more efficiently and effectively.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama ‘Not a Fighter’: In a series of speeches on the economy, President Barack Obama so far has not laid out fresh plans, The Associated Press reported. Sen. Bernie Sanders said Obama needed to, but did not, outline bold new legislation to create jobs through a major program to fix highways, shore up bridges, overhaul airports and seaports and rebuild railways. Sanders said the president should have gotten tough and told Republicans that “if they are not prepared to go forward they are going to pay a political price” but “he's not a fighter and the Republicans have gotten that clue.”  Obama ‘Not a Fighter’: Obama's program for boosting the middle class, which he is laying out in a series of speeches, faces long odds in a Congress that showed little interest when he proposed similar ideas earlier this year. Some Democrats are looking for Obama to become more assertive. “If you're asking me if I am optimistic that he's going to come down here and fight and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse—no. The president is not a fighter,” Sen. Sanders, an independent who generally votes with the Democratic majority, told The Wall Street Journal.   The Fed: Sen. Sanders urged the president to nominate a new Fed chairman who would be an advocate for the middle class, AP reported. Sanders suggested Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz or former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Sanders said the Fed needs to address unemployment with the same urgency it showed after the financial crisis in 2008, WCAX-TV reported. “Among the many reasons the country would be better off if Bernie Sanders was president is that the man just refuses to deal in silliness. He wants the country to have a serious debate” about the Federal Reserve mandate to promote full employment, Jonathan Tasini blogged.   Veterans' Home: Gov. Peter Shumlin asked the state Legislature for $2 million to cover Vermont Veterans Home deficits. Deeper federal cuts would make the problem worse. David Weinstein, a Sanders aide, told the Bennington Banner that the home remains under scrutiny by the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, which last year threatened to withdraw federal funding which accounts for most of the home's $21 million budget. Weinstein said Sanders last week asked CMS for time "to right the ship." Sanders, who chairs the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, also is working to help the facility care for patients from nearby Massachusetts, according to the Banner, Vt. Digger and the Valley News.    Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=4CA71040-2EDE-45D4-BF36-EDC0F36F354D
Income Inequality:   Four out of 5 U.S. adults struggle with joblessness, near-poverty or reliance on welfare for at least parts of their lives, according to a survey for The Associated Press. Releasing the findings on Monday, AP cited an increasingly globalized U.S. economy, the widening gap between rich and poor, and the loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs. Sen. Bernie Sanders discussed income inequality in America during a television interview broadcast Sunday. “The main goal, to my mind, is to revitalize the economy, create the millions of jobs we want, to raise the minimum wage so that people have work and decent income,” Sanders told Scott Rasmussen on “What America Thinks.”  Read the article here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=bade8889-cffd-4e82-8b99-df36bac3e06c
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The Fed: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday urged President Obama to appoint a new Federal Reserve chairman who will “put the needs of the disappearing middle class ahead of the interests of Wall Street and the wealthy few.” Sanders believes that either economist Joseph Stiglitz or former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich would make "excellent candidates,” to succeed Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term ends on Jan. 31, WPTZ-TV reported.  The Fed: Senators on Sunday reminded Obama that the next Fed chief is not solely his choice to make – they have to confirm his pick — and continued a growing push to topple a leading contender, Lawrence Summers, who previously was  a top economic aide to Obama and was one of President Clinton’s Treasury secretary. “Larry Summers had been very supportive of the era of deregulation,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein said on CNN’s State of the Union. Sen. Sanders blamed Summers for contributing to “the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression” and said it “would be a tragic mistake to nominate anyone as chair of the Fed who continued those failed policies,” The Wall Street Journal reported online.  Tax Reform: The Senate Finance Committee promised senators 50 years’ worth of secrecy in exchange for suggestions on what deductions and credits to preserve in tax reform. Sen. Sanders turned down the offer for secrecy, noting that he had nothing to hide. He outlined five major tax proposals that, together, would raise $1.8 trillion in revenue over the next decade, according to Daily Kos.  Solar Power: Energy Co-op of Vermont is expanding a solar water heating program to cover Addison County. Support from high-profile officials such as Sen. Sanders was instrumental in getting this year’s program off the ground February, the Rutland Herald reported in Monday editions.

Time for New Leadership at the Fed:  Saying that “it’s time for new leadership at the Federal Reserve and a new approach to our troubled economy,” Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday urged President Obama to appoint a new central bank chairman who will “put the needs of the disappearing middle class ahead of the interests of Wall Street and the wealthy few.”  Sanders said Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich would be “excellent candidates” to replace Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term ends next January 31.

Must Read: Fighting Back Against Wretched Wages - Steven Greenhouse, The New York Times  OFTEN relegated to the background, America’s low-wage workers have been making considerable noise lately by deploying an unusual weapon — one-day strikes — to make their message heard: they’re sick and tired of earning just $8, $9, $10 an hour.  Their anger has been stoked by what they see as a glaring disconnect: their wages have flatlined, while median pay for chief executives at the nation’s top corporations jumped 16 percent last year, averaging a princely $15.1 million, according to Equilar, an executive compensation analysis firm.  In recent weeks, workers from McDonald’s, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurants — many of them part-time employees — have staged one-day walkouts in New York, Chicago, Detroit and Seattle to protest their earnings, typically just $150 to $350 a week, often too little to support themselves and their families. More walkouts are expected at fast-food restaurants in seven cities on Monday. Earlier this month hundreds of low-wage employees working for federal contractors in Washington walked out and picketed along Pennsylvania Avenue to urge President Obama to press their employers to raise wages.  Ana Salvador, who earns $10 an hour after 10 years working at the McDonald’s inside the National Air and Space Museum, wrote Mr. Obama to say that she did not earn enough to support her four children, adding that her family relied on food stamps and Medicaid. Another striker, Karla Quezada, who has worked at the Subway inside the Ronald Reagan Building for 11 years, said that while her employer made “lots of money off of my work, I still only make $9.50 an hour.” This is higher than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage as well as the District of Columbia’s $8.25 minimum — many states have minimums above the federal level — but it isn’t much after more than a decade on the job. In a speech in Galesburg, Ill., last Wednesday aimed at bolstering the middle class, Mr. Obama called for raising the minimum wage.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Tax Reform: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday provided suggestions for tax reform to the Senate Finance Committee, Politico reported. Chairman Max Baucus and ranking member Orrin Hatch had asked for member input and offered to keep any suggestions secret for 50 years. Sanders declined the offer of secrecy, The Hill reported online. “Given the fact that my suggestions represent the interests of the middle class of this country and not powerful corporate special interests, I have no problem with making them public,” he said.  Polluter Tax: Sen. Sanders asked the Senate’s tax-writing committee to consider a $20 per ton tax on carbon and methane emissions as part of a comprehensive tax reform package, The Hill and Environment and Energy Daily reported. In addition to pricing carbon, Sanders also recommended reducing oil and gas tax breaks.  Income Inequality: Sen. Sanders discussed income inequality in America during an interview by Scott Rasmussen on “What America Thinks.” ‘The main goal, to my mind, is to revitalize the economy, create the millions of jobs we want, to raise the minimum wage so that people have work and decent income,” Sanders said in the program broadcast Saturday on WFOR-TV in Miami, KYW-TV in Philadelphia and other.   The Fed: Several Senate Democrats are backing Janet Yellen to be the next Federal Reserve chairman, according to Financial Times. Rumors about a nomination for Larry Summers have united many progressives around Yellen. A number of liberals, including Sens. Sanders and Jeff Merkley, voted against the current Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, on grounds that he bore some responsibility for the financial crisis.

The Week in Review:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday laid out detailed tax reform proposals in letters to the Senate Finance Committee. They offered to keep senators’ submissions secret for 50 years. Sanders declined.  The Senate on Wednesday passed legislation that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will drive up what it costs students and their parents to borrow money for college. While President Obama was speaking at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., about helping the middle class, his White House aides were corralling votes for the student loan deal that mirrored a bill already passed by House Republicans. One reason the minimum wage should be increased is to prod Wal-Mart into paying its workers enough so the workers don’t have to rely on food stamps and Medicaid, Sanders argued in an interview on Wednesday. The Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs on Wednesday approved a package of bills to improve benefits, including one to keep better track of efforts by the VA to eliminate an unacceptable backlog of cases.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   NSA Surveillance: The House on Wednesday narrowly defeated an effort to stop the federal government from systematically gathering telecommunications metadata, but Congress is considering other ways to reform a National Security Agency surveillance program, according to ProPublica. Sen. Sanders has introduced legislation to raise the standard for what records are considered "relevant" to national security investigations.   College Costs: Interest rates on federal student loans would rise under legislation passed by the Senate. Sen. Sanders was one of 18 senators to oppose the bill, according to MSNBC. "We ask more of parents and young people to go to college than any other major country on earth," Sanders told Ed Schultz on Thursday. In the Burlington Free Press online, Sanders said “the idea of passing legislation that in a few years is going to make an already bad situation of student indebtedness even worse is absolutely absurd.”   Solar Power: Energy Co-op of Vermont is expanding a solar water heating program to Addison County. The program is designed to help Vermont homeowners and businesses save money and energy through heating their water with solar power. Support from high-profile officials such as Sen. Sanders was instrumental in getting the program off the ground, the Times Argus and Rutland Herald reported.   USPS: Sen. Sanders said a House bill to end door-to-door mail delivery is part of a “radical” Republican effort to eliminate the U.S Postal Service. “It will cost us up to 100,000 workers. It will slow down the delivery of first class mail. It will lead to the closing of half of the processing plants in the country. It will eliminate Saturday mail. It will lead to the possibility of shutting down thousands of rural post offices. Let’s understand that the people who wrote this bill in the House do not believe government should be doing anything. They believe the private sector should be doing it all,” Sanders told Ed Schultz.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=0387B3DF-E65F-40F9-9309-A420B0DF01E2
Wal-Mart Wages:  Opposition to raising the minimum wage in the United States comes from companies like Wal-Mart. While the Walton family that owns the giant discount retailer is worth about $100 billion, Sen. Bernie Sanders told Chris Hayes on MSNBC that the company pays its workers so little that they must resort to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidized housing. By paying workers so little, Wal-Mart “compels taxpayers to pick up a tab that wouldn’t even exist if the company paid its workers enough to get them out of poverty,” Harold Meyerson wrote in The Washington Post. To help workers and save taxpayers’ money, Sanders is a cosponsor of a bill to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Student Loan Bill Passes Senate: Borrowing costs for college students and their parents could soon start climbing under a bill the Senate passed overwhelmingly Wednesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders joined 16 Democrats and Republican Sen. Mike Lee to oppose the legislation, The Associated Press and Los Angeles Times reported. “This bill makes a bad situation worse," Sanders said on National Public Radio. He offered an amendment to sunset the legislation in two years, but it was rejected, USA Today and The Washington Post reported.   Working Families Betrayed: As the bill was debated, a discordant scene played out as conservative Republicans praised the Democrats they had worked with to strike a deal, and liberal senators like Sanders and Elizabeth Warren accused their colleagues of forcing through a bill that betrayed their party’s promises to working families, The New York Times reported. “What I don’t understand,” Sanders said, “is when you have a Democratic president, a Democratically controlled U.S. Senate, why we are producing a bill which is basically a Republican bill?”   Wal-Mart Welfare: Opposition to raising the minimum wage in the United States comes from companies like Wal-Mart. While the family that owns the giant discount retailer is worth about $100 billion, heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune also are “the major welfare recipients in America,” Sen. Sanders told Chris Hayes on MSNBC. The company pays its workers so little that they must resort to Medicaid, food stamps and subsidized housing, Sanders said.   VA Backlog: A Senate panel backed eight veterans bills Wednesday. Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said one of the measures would require the Veterans Affairs Department to report publicly on its progress in reducing the backlog of pending disability benefits claims. “The secretary has outlined a very ambitious goal to address the claims backlog. We want to make sure that he and his staff are meeting those ambitious goals,” Congressional Quarterly reported.

Senate Votes to Raise Student Loan Rates:   The Senate today voted 81-18 on Wednesday for a college loan bill that would lead to higher interest rates for students and parents who borrow money for college. The vote came after the Senate rejected an amendment by Sanders to have the bill expire after two years. That’s when the sharpest increases in interest rates are expected to occur. “The idea of passing legislation that in a few years is going to make an already bad situation of student indebtedness even worse is absolutely absurd,” Sanders had said in a floor speech earlier in the day calling for the two-year sunset provision. The vote on the Sanders amendment was 34-65.  A member of the Senate education committee, Sanders cited Congressional Budget Office projections that under the Senate-passed bill interest rates would hit 7.25 percent for undergraduate loans in five years. By 2018, graduate loans would go up to 8.8 percent and parents would be charged 9.8 percent on loans for their children to attend college, according to the analysis by the non-partisan agency that provides economic data for Congress.

At a time when Democrats control the White House and the U.S. Senate, we should not support bad legislation almost identical to that passed by a very conservative, Republican-led House. Our job is to listen to the people who elected us and stand up for working families and their kids, not make their lives more difficult.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama ‘Disingenuous’ on Student Loans: President Barack Obama has teamed up with congressional Republicans to push a student loan bill that Sen. Bernie Sanders said will raise college costs for students and parents, Roll Call and the Washington Examiner reported. Sanders said it was disingenuous for the White House to tout lower rates in the bill’s first year while trying to sweep under the rug interest costs that will soon balloon, according to WCAX-TV and WPTZ-TV.   Obama Sold Out to Republicans: The compromise negotiated in the Senate closely hews to what House Republicans passed earlier this year — a sticking point for Sanders and several other senators, The Associated Press reported. "At a time when Democrats control the White House and the U.S. Senate, we should not support bad legislation almost identical to that passed by a very conservative, Republican-led House," said Sanders. “Our job is to listen to the people who elected us and stand up for working families and their kids, not make their lives more difficult,” Sanders added in The Washington Post online.   The Sanders Amendment: In a bid to shore up Democratic support, Majority Leader Harry Reid said the Senate would vote on amendments, including one by Sen. Sanders to sunset the compromise bill in two years before interest rates are expected to rise, The Boston Globe and Rochester, N.Y., Democrat and Chronicle reported. "The idea of passing legislation that in a few years down the road is going to make the situation much worse is absolutely absurd," he said. Sanders wants to work out a better solution during the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, Congressional Quarterly reported.   Domestic Spying: Several Democrats and Republicans in Congress have proposed legislation to rein in National Security Agency domestic surveillance programs, reported MSNBC. Sen. Sanders put forth a proposal to restrict Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. Sens. Patrick Leahy, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall have proposed similar changes.

Selling Out the Future:   Interest rates that students and parents pay on college loans would soar under legislation pushed Tuesday by the Obama administration and the president’s allies among congressional Republicans.  Sen. Bernie Sanders was working with others to block the proposal or at least make it less onerous for middle-class families trying to afford increasingly costly higher education. He said a “disingenuous” White House report tried to sweep under the rug the big rate hikes that the Congressional Budget Office said were likely in coming years if the legislation is enacted. Sanders will offer a floor amendment that would put a two-year expiration date on the legislation. That would avoid the worst of the rate increases while he and other members of the Senate education committee come up with a better way to control college costs during next year’s reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Sanders also questioned the President Obama’s political tin ear. “At a time when Democrats control the White House and the U.S. Senate, we should not support bad legislation almost identical to that passed by a very conservative, Republican-led House,” said Sanders. “Our job is to listen to the people who elected us and stand up for working families and their kids, not make their lives more difficult.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=8A8D9539-22C4-4D89-A821-E56BCD6C3B91

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders Wants 2-Year Limit on ‘Dangerous’ College Loans Bill: The Senate is set to vote this week on a compromise proposal which would let student loan interest rates climb as high as 8.25 percent, The Hill and Politico reported. A member of the Senate Education Committee, Sanders intends to offer an amendment that would put a two-year limit on the deal so Congress, when it takes up reauthorization of the Higher Education Act next year, could look at ways to make college more affordable, the Burlington Free Press reported online.   Most Senate Dems Oppose Obama’s Deal: Senate Democratic leaders are negotiating whether to allow votes on a handful of amendments from liberal lawmakers to a bipartisan agreement reached last week on student-loan rates. Democratic aides described the amendment process as fluid, but the list of possible changes included submissions from Sens. Sanders, Patty Murray, Jeff Merkley and Jack Reed. according to National Journal. The unease with the agreement raises the likelihood that it may not pass with a Democratic majority. Democratic vote-counters now put the number of likely votes from their party “in the low 20s,” according to a leadership aide.  Sanders Asks Obama to Back Off Deal with Republicans: “Just when they thought they had a plan together a number of Democrats objected, and strongly ... Sen. Sanders suggested President Obama step in and rethink the whole thing,” Vic Ratner of ABC News said on KOMO-AM in Seattle, Wash. But the veteran Capitol Hill newsman predicted that the Senate will pass the White House-engineered deal that mirrors legislation passed by the Republican-run House. “I think they’re going to get it done over the protests and objections.”   Veterans’ Affairs: The Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, which Sen. Sanders chairs, could finish work on a number of bills Wednesday, including one that brings the Department of Veterans Affairs in line with the recent Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, a measure to provide benefits for veterans who were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military and a bill to mandate reports from the VA on its backlog of claims for disability benefits, the Burlington Free Press reported.

Obama College Loan Bill Hurts Students:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday urged President Obama to withdraw his support for a dangerous bill likely to cause a substantial jump in college loan interest rates for students and parents in years to come.   Under a so-called bipartisan proposal, interest rates would go up in five years to 7.25 percent for undergraduate loans, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. An undergraduate student could be forced to pay $5,462 more over the life of a loan than they would have been charged under rates in effect for the past two years. If the same CBO projections come true, parents by 2018 would be charged 9.7 percent on college loans.  “At a time when the average student is graduating from a four-year college $27,000 in debt, when hundreds of thousands of capable young people no longer see college as an option because of high costs and when the U.S. is falling further and further behind our economic competitors in terms of the percentage of young people graduating from college, no agreement should be passed which, over a period of years, makes a bad situation worse and will make college even less affordable than it is today,” Sanders said.  “At a time when Democrats control the White House and the U.S. Senate, we should not support bad legislation almost identical to that passed by a very conservative, Republican-led House. Our job is to listen to the people who elected us and stand up for working families and their kids, not make their lives more difficult.”  The Senate could vote as early as Tuesday on the student loan legislation. Sanders has proposed an amendment that would place a two-year limit on the deal. Adding a so-called sunset provision to the bill would give Congress time to focus on ways to make college more affordable before economists expect the significant interest rate increase to take effect. The Senate education committee is scheduled next year to take up legislation to reauthorize the Higher Education Act.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Student Loans: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid may start debate as soon as Tuesday on a bipartisan compromise to reduce interest rates on federal student loans without a guarantee that most of the chamber’s Democrats will vote for it. The bill would peg loan rates to the 10-year Treasury note. Sens. Bernie Sanders, Jack Reed and Elizabeth Warren opposed the deal because it continues a government program they believe is based more on revenue generation than helping the students, arguing the program creates profits of $184 billion over the next 10 years, Politico reported.   Filibusters: The Senate this week is expected to fill National Labor Relations Board vacancies as part of a deal that cleared the way for Senate votes on a few of President Obama’s nominees but “as Sen. Bernie Sanders said on my radio show this week, it is not enough,” Ed Schultz said Sunday on MSNBC. Schultz said Sanders was “spot on” when he said, “The real issue is how do we deal with the overall dysfunctionality of the United States Senate where the enormous problems in our country – the high unemployment, the growing gap between the wealthy and everybody else, the issue a climate change, the fact that many kids can't afford to go to college right now, crumbling infrastructure … – we're not getting … even serious debates on these issues. To pass anything in the United States Senate right now requires 60 votes and the Republicans are abusing the filibuster privilege and demanding 60 votes on virtually every issue.”   Obama Plans to Unveil His Agenda for Economy: With major battles looming in the fall over the federal budget and the debt ceiling, President Obama is trying to regain the initiative, embarking on a campaign-style tour of the Midwest this week to lay out his agenda for reinvigorating the nation’s economy, administration officials said Sunday. Obama’s offensive will begin on Wednesday in Galesburg, Ill., with what his aides are saying will be a major address on economic policy at Knox College, The New York Times reported.   Detroit Bankruptcy: The battle over the future of Detroit is set to begin this week in federal court, where government leaders will square off against retirees in a colossal debate over what the city owes to a prior generation of residents as it tries to rebuild for the next. Groups representing the 20,000 retirees won a county court order that effectively freezes the bankruptcy process, but officials are asking a federal judge to hold hearings early this week to validate the bankruptcy and move forward with a strategy for Detroit to discharge much of its estimated $19 billion debt, The Washington Post reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   African-American Youth: Sen. Bernie Sanders praised President Obama’s “very moving speech” on Friday about the African-American perspective on the acquittal in Florida of the man who shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. Sanders added during a Saturday interview on MSNBC, “I hope [Obama] now begins to talk about what is happening to millions of African-American kids and young people in general in this country who, as a result of this disastrous economy, are unable to get even entry-level jobs.” The Senate last month passed a $1.5 billion youth jobs bill sponsored by Sanders.   Trayvon Martin Rallies: Thousands gathered Saturday at rallies in more than 100 cities nationwide to press for federal civil rights charges in the case of the 2012 confrontation in Sanford, Fla., and to attack stand-your-ground self-defense laws. Sen. Sanders on Friday told radio host Thom Hartmann that such laws were “incredibly stupid and dangerous.”  Detroit Bankruptcy: Sen. Sanders said the city that once led the world in automobile manufacturing declined as a result of U.S. trade policies that sent American factory jobs overseas. “What you're seeing in Detroit is the result of horrendous trade policies that have gone on for decades which resulted in the shutdowns of tens of thousands of factories in America,” Sanders said Saturday on The Ed Show on MSNBC.  Filibuster: As part of a deal last week to let the Senate vote on some of President Obama’s Cabinet nominees, filibuster rules were left intact that don’t let senators “respond to the needs of the American people in a timely and effective way,” Sen. Sanders said. “He catalogued a few of those needs, including a real unemployment rate around 14 percent, a truly wasteful health-care system, eroding infrastructures and college grads with mountainous debt. Partly due to the self-imprisonment of the Senate’s own rules, said Sanders, many critical issues just don’t get addressed. He is correct,” James Warren wrote in the New York Daily News.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Rail Trail: Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexis Nelson, executive director of the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers, broke ground Friday in St. Johnsbury on the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. Sen. Sanders helped secure a $5.2 million grant for trail construction, according to the cutline with a page-one photo in Saturday’s Caledonian-Record. Saturday’s Times Argus also carried a story on the project. LINK, LINK  VA Faulted: Medical staff at the Department of Veterans Affairs aren’t recognizing signs of sexual abuse in former troops and haven’t been properly treating victims, veterans said at a congressional hearing. Sens. Sanders, who leads the Senate veterans committee, and Jon Tester urged the VA in a letter last month to improve the way it processes post-traumatic stress disorder claims from veterans tied to sexual trauma, Bloomberg reported.   Money in Politics: While it is now known that the IRS did not only target conservative political groups seeking tax-exempt status as “social welfare" organizations, Rep. Ted Deutch said “the real scandal” all along was the role of money in politics. A constitution amendment proposed by Deutch and Sen. Sanders would undo the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling and ensure that “no IRS agent would ever again be tasked with evaluating the political conduct of a tax-exempt nonprofit,” Deutch wrote in The Huffington Post   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=012e9999-9fda-4b89-aa07-a64b00787a9d #Vt #Vermont #Solar #CitizensUnited #SEC
The Week in Review:   Under pressure from the White House, Senate leaders agreed Wednesday on a plan to tie federal student loan interest rates to rising market rates. Sen. Bernie Sanders and others are fighting for a better deal. “We want to encourage people to go to college, not discourage them,” Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. After much talk about the need to end Senate gridlock, senators reached a very narrow deal on Tuesday that resulted in no real reform of filibuster rules abuse by Senate Republicans. The showdown cleared a way for the confirmation of two Cabinet members on Thursday. Senate environment committee Republicans on Thursday contradicted or ignored the near-unanimous consensus by climate scientists that global warming is real and man-made. To Sanders, it was an Alice in Wonderland experience.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=4F4223B6-803B-4AAC-9A5D-FE25DFD8553C
VIDEO: Sen. Sanders responds to a new deal to change student loan rates: http://youtu.be/kLR4kqQKNLk
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: Partisan differences over global warming flared during a Senate hearing Thursday. Democrats on the Senate environment committee called climate-change skeptics delusional and stressed that virtually every scientist agrees that global warming is real and caused by humans. Sen. Bernie Sanders cited the “overwhelming” evidence, Gannett News Service reported. “To deny the fact that the overwhelming majority of scientists who have published peer review articles believe not only is global warming real, but it is man-made, and to continue discussion of ‘we are not sure, let’s look at something else’, is almost beyond intellectual comprehension,” Sanders said in the Los Angeles Times.   Student Loans: Under pressure from the White House, Senate leaders plan to tie federal student loan interest rates to market rates which are expected to rise. Sen. Sanders “says the deal is a disaster because rates could rise to 8.5 percent,” Bob Kinzel tweeted for Vermont Public Radio. The Boston Globe said Sanders plans an amendment that would sunset the bill in two years before interest rates are expected to rise. He urged colleagues not to “collapse on this issue. Roll Call doubted that amendments by Sens. Jack Reed and Sanders would pass.  Rail Trail: Sen. Sanders will take part in a ground-breaking ceremony for the long-awaited Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, The Caledonian-Record reported. Sanders will be in St. Johnsbury on Friday evening for the event. The independent senator secured a $5.2 million grant for the trail in 2005. But it wasn't until last fall that the project was cleared for construction to start. Sanders' office says the rail trail will eventually run 93 miles between Swanton and St. Johnsbury along a former railroad right-of-way, The Associated Press, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported.   High-Speed Internet: “It’s nice to be on the cusp of a technology revolution for a change,” the Brattleboro Reformer said in an editorial about Sen. Sanders’ announcement that some towns in southeastern Vermont are getting the fastest consumer connection to the Internet anywhere in the United States. “Vermont may be on the verge of reaping enormous dividends from this historic investment in our future,” Sanders said of the new fiber optic service.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  High-Speed Internet: A region in southeastern Vermont will receive the fastest consumer connection to the Internet anywhere in the United States, according to the office of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Springfield and 13 neighboring towns are getting Internet access at speeds 100 times faster than average and faster than anywhere else in the country except for a Kansas City, Mo., pilot project by Google, the Claremont, N.H., Eagle Times and the Brattleboro Reformer reported. Sanders said the goal is to attract businesses and create jobs, ABC 22 and Fox 44 reported.   Filibusters: As the Senate voted Wednesday on another of President Obama’s long-stalled nominees, Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz that Obama "deserves to have the Cabinet of his choice." Despite the short-term deal to clear the way for confirmation votes, Sanders told Vermont Public Radio that Senate filibuster rules still give the minority too much leverage to block legislation. "Right now, obstructionism is taking place in an unprecedented way," he noted.   Student Loans: The Senate could vote as early as today on a deal that would offer students better rates this fall but then costs likely would climb. Instead, Congress should listen to Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch and “not further burden students and their families,” Scott Giles of the Vermont Student Assistance Corp. concluded in a Caledonian-Record op-ed. Also calling the compromise a bad deal for future students, Richard Eskow argued at Truthout for a plan by Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to lower costs for students.  Campaign Records: Sen. Sanders joined a group of 15 senators who filed campaign finance reports electronically this quarter, reported the Houston Chronicle. Electronic filing cuts out weeks or months of processing time, allowing viewers to see reports sooner.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Filibusters: Sen. Bernie Sanders welcomed an agreement that clears the way for long-stalled confirmation votes on several of President Barack Obama's nominees but warned that more must be done to end Senate gridlock, The Associated Press and Rutland Herald reported. “While this agreement addresses the immediate need for the president of the United States to have his Cabinet and his senior staff confirmed, this agreement today only addresses one symptom of a seriously dysfunctional Senate,” Sanders said on “The News Hour” on PBS. Sanders said the minority party's ability to scuttle legislation supported by a majority was “a perversion of democracy,” according to Seven Days.  “What I support is the talking filibuster,” Sanders said on The Diane Rehm Show on NPR and in The Hill.  Filibusters: Real reform is still necessary, John Nichols agreed with Sanders in a blog for The Nation. Also arguing that the deal did too little was James Warren in the New York Daily News. “Heaven forbid one should ditch a system where, as Sanders noted, it just takes one senator to utter the words ‘I object’ and the system essentially comes to a halt.” Writing in The Huffington Post, Richard Eskow said “We don't need senators who pal up to Republicans and corporations. We need senators [like Sanders] who stand up to them.”  Vermont Edition: Sen. Sanders will join Jane Lindholdm and Sage Van Wing on Vermont Public Radio Wednesday at noon to discuss the Senate showdown over filibusters.   Lopez May Stay: Vermont immigrant activist Danilo Lopez has been granted a reprieve allowing him to remain in the United States. He had been ordered to leave by July 5. The 23-year-old from Chiapas, Mexico, said he had been helped in his bid to stay by an outpouring of public support, including letters from Vermont’s four top elected officials, including Sen. Sanders, according to The Associated Press, Seven Days, Times Argus and Bennington Banner.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=BF706185-7E60-4564-9C33-1FF781CE95DE

Short-Term Filibuster Fix Won't Cure Gridlock:  An agreement that clears the way for long-stalled confirmation votes on several of President Barack Obama’s nominees was welcomed on Wednesday by Sen. Bernie Sanders, but he warned that more must be done to end gridlock in a “seriously dysfunctional” Senate.  “I am pleased that an agreement has been reached in which President Obama finally will get Senate confirmation votes on his nominees to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Labor and the Environmental Protection Agency. This agreement also provides that new nominees for the National Labor Relations Board will be rapidly confirmed,” Sanders said. “While this addresses an immediate need for the president of the United States to have his Cabinet and other senior officials confirmed, we should be clear that the agreement only addresses one symptom of a seriously dysfunctional U.S. Senate,” he added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders on Filibusters: Senators held a three-and a-half-hour meeting in the Old Senate Chamber Monday evening to discuss the partisan standoff over President Barack Obama's executive-branch nominees. On Tuesday morning, Sen. Bernie Sanders discussed the issue on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal saying “My view is that the minority has the right to talk as long as they want, but at the end of the day we have to be able to vote.”   Tyranny of the Minority: Senate Republicans have vastly expanded on traditional minority party rights, according to The Nation. With hundreds of filibusters, Republicans effectually brought flow in the upper chamber to a screeching halt. “The Senate is not the House and the minority party must be treated with respect and given the opportunity to offer amendments and make their case in opposition,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders on the filibuster issue. “A minority must not, however, be allowed to permanently obstruct the wishes of the majority. That is not democracy. That is a perversion of democracy.”   Vermont Jobs: Dozens of former IBM employees attended the Vermont Department of Labor’s job fair on Monday.  Sen. Sanders said that as a nation, the United States has at least two major economic problems: unemployment is “much too high” particularly if those who have given up looking for a job and those who work part-time are taken into account. Secondly, Sanders said, while unemployment is too high, there are jobs all over Vermont and the country that employers can’t find employees to fill. “That’s what today is all about,” Sanders said. “Matching your skills to the jobs that are available,” the Burlington Free Press reported.   Youth Jobs: A Summer Work Travel program brings young foreign students to the U.S. to study and work for four months, but to critics like Sen. Sanders say the program robs America's youth of employment opportunities, according to MSN Money, the Microsoft news portal. “On street corners all over this country, there are kids who have nothing to do," Sanders said. "Many of the jobs that used to be done by young Americans are now being performed by foreign college students.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=09AC48CA-6E78-44BF-9FB3-7A84F756D9B1
End Gridlock:   Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday stood firm on his plan to end Republican filibusters of executive branch nominations. Reid said he would forge ahead with his plan to change Senate rules unless Republicans relent in their latest effort to block Senate consideration of President Obama’s Cabinet selections and other senior administration posts. Sen. Bernie Sanders supports Reid’s effort to break through the gridlock. During the six years when Lyndon Johnson was majority leader in the 1950s, he had to overcome a filibuster only one time, Sanders noted. During the time Harry Reid has been the Senate leader, he has had to try to overcome filibusters 420 times. “Enough is enough,” Sanders said.  The rules change proposed by Reid would only apply to Senate confirmation votes on executive branch nominees. Sanders would go further. He would change Senate rules that have let the minority thwart action on legislation.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=3B7BB8B6-42C5-4EDA-AB5B-6012607A3228

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Fair Taxes: Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus and Sen. Orrin Hatch, the panel's top Republican, told fellow senators last month that they plan to move forward on a tax code overhaul. They gave other senators until July 26 to make their case for tax benefits that should remain on the books. Many senators are reluctant to bite but Sens. Bernie Sanders and Tom Carper told Politico that they plan to submit letters to Baucus and Hatch.   Student Loans: Colleges and universities have traditionally offered a breadth of social and human knowledge. Not anymore. Corporations want to turn college education into an employee training program. We need to demand that politicians refuse any increase in student loan rates. We need to stand firmly behind the educational positions of Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Richard (RJ) Eskow wrote for The Huffington Post.   Jobs: The Vermont Department of Labor is holding a job fair today for workers laid off from IBM and elsewhere. More than 80 different employers will have tables at the fair. Gov. Peter Shumlin and Sen. Sanders will attend, ABC 22 and Fox 44 reported.  Cape Air: Six years after it began its Rutland-to-Boston service, Cape Air plans to add a daily flight to the New York City area and open a ticket office in downtown Rutland. A request for a federal subsidy has the support of the state’s congressional delegation. In a joint letter to the Department of Transportation, Sens. Patrick Leahy and Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch noted the importance of the current Boston air service to the economy of southern Vermont, the Rutland Herald reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Tax Fairness: Sen. Bernie Sanders listed 10 of the biggest and most profitable U.S. companies that have been paying little or no income taxes including Exxon-Mobil, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. Sanders even introduced legislation to impose a surtax on millionaires that would have yielded some $50 billion a year, according to an op-ed by Wolf D. Fuhrig in the Jacksonville, Ill., Journal Courier.   Jobs: Vermont can expect to see 132,000 job openings this decade — jobs that will require education and training beyond high school, according to a national report. To meet the challenge, technical centers at some Vermont high schools are preparing students for more advanced training, available at Vermont Technical College in Randolph, the University of Vermont in Burlington, Green Mountain College in Poultney and other Vermont institutions. Stafford Technical Center, associated with Rutland High School, will launch its own two-year program next year, the Rutland Herald reported.   Homeless Cuts: The Vermont Agency of Human Services ended its fiscal year June 30 with a $4 million tab to place homeless people lacking shelter in temporary lodging — eight times the $500,000 bill of five years ago, when the state relaxed its rules limiting aid to those fleeing a fire, natural disaster or domestic violence. The state Legislature has cut the annual figure by more than half, to $1.5 million, for the fiscal year that began July 1, the Rutland Herald reported.

The minority party must not be allowed to permanently obstruct the wishes of the majority. That is not democracy. http://t.co/XU6m4OvkKO
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Filibusters: Senate Democrats are prepared to change the chamber's rules in order to overcome unprecedented obstructionism from Republicans, Sen. Bernie Sanders told Dick Helton on KNX-AM all-news radio in Los Angeles on Friday. "When Lyndon Johnson, in the late 1950s, was majority leader, he had to overcome a filibuster one time during his tenure. Harry Reid has had to try to overcome filibusters 413 times," noted Sanders. Majority Leader Reid wants to allow the Senate to confirm Cabinet and other executive branch nominees by a simple majority vote. He plans a vote on the rules change on Tuesday   Student Loans: Student loan rates stuck at 6.8 percent this week after Republicans filibustered legislation that would retroactively lower rates, Sen. Sanders told Thom Hartmann on Friday. A potential deal between Democrats and Republicans would tie student loan interest rates to treasury rates. Sanders said he has "serious concerns" about that compromise, which would raise rates on students over the next few years.  Guest Workers: President Barack Obama's administration is taking steps to clean up a controversial foreign-student work program that allows American companies to hire young laborers from other countries for temporary positions, Bloomberg Businessweek reported. Rife with employee abuses, the program’s new restrictions require student sponsors to vet employers and contact students monthly to monitor their welfare and location. The program recently drew fire from Sen. Sanders. “Many of the jobs that used to be done by young Americans are now being performed by foreign college students,” he lamented.

The Week in Review:   The Senate majority leader, exasperated by Senate Republicans’ serial stalling tactics, on Thursday proposed new rules for confirming Cabinet nominees. Under the proposal, a majority of senators, not the extraordinary 60 needed now, could confirm the president’s picks. Sen. Bernie Sanders supports the change. He would go further and extend the majority-rule principle to bills before the Senate. Legislation to lower student loan interest rates got 51 votes on Wednesday, for example, but it fell nine short of the supermajority needed to overcome the parliamentary roadblock that Republicans erected.  “Enough is enough,” Sanders told Thom Hartmann Friday on his weekly radio and Internet program. Also on Capitol Hill during the past week, Sanders and others pressed the White House to do more on global warming. And on Wednesday, a Senate panel advanced legislation to outlaw discrimination by employers against gays, a proposal Sanders first cosponsored in the House nearly a decade ago.

Tyranny of the Minority: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=11CF457A-8809-4616-99AF-B3E5DBB98282
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Student Loans: Sen. Bernard Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to read some of the 700 emails he’s received from Vermonters and others nationwide who are calling for a return to a lower interest rate on federal student loans. “What is happening in Vermont and across the country is a real crisis,” Sanders told the Rutland Herald. “We have a crisis where working-class families are being forced to reconsider investing in their child’s education and a better future.”   Energy Independence: “As we make the transition from a buggy-whip economy to a 21st-century economy, from one form of energy to another, those people who can't really afford to make the transition we should help out,” radio host Thom Hartmann told a caller on Thursday. “I agree with Bernie Sanders on this … We should be giving tax credits or even outright payments to people who have to drive a long way to get to work and to people who live in the … north and pay a lot to heat their homes … [so] as a nation were no longer going to be dependent upon the Osama bin Ladens of the world for our fuel.”   Filibuster Reform: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters that Senate Democrats are prepared to limit filibusters on executive branch and Cabinet nominees, reported Roll Call. Democrats and Republicans are slated to attend a special joint meeting Monday evening to discuss expediting the confirmation process. On Tuesday, the majority leader plans votes to confirm all seven nominees.   House Approves Farm Bill, Minus Food Stamps: The House of Representatives passed a farm bill Thursday stripped of provisions for the nation's food stamp program, reported The New York Times. Conservatives remain determined to extract deep cuts to the nation's nutrition programs. No Democrats voted for the bill.

Tyranny of the Minority:  Finally confronting bare-knuckle Republican obstruction tactics, the Senate on Thursday began to debate changing its rules for confirming presidential nominees. Under a proposal by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a majority of senators, not the extraordinary 60 votes needed under existing rules, could shut off debate over nominations for Cabinet posts and other senior administration jobs subject to Senate confirmation. Sen. Bernie Sanders wholeheartedly agrees with Reid. “With rare exceptions, a president should have the right to appoint his team to implement the policies he was elected to carry out,” Sanders said. What brought the issue to a head were the long-stalled nominations of Thomas Perez to head the Department of Labor and Gina McCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans also have dragged out the confirmation process on nominees to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which they opposed creating in the first place, and the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces workplace laws they don’t like.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Student Loans: Sen. Bernie Sanders said he's disappointed that a Republican filibuster blocked legislation in the U.S. Senate that was designed to have student loan interest rates revert to what they were before they doubled on July 1 to 6.8 percent. Sanders said he's heard from more than 700 Vermonters and people around the country that borrowing for college costs too much, reported The Associated Press, the Burlington Free Press, WCAX-TV and Politicus USA. “We must continue working to find a short-term solution to keep interest rates down while developing a long-term solution to make college more affordable for working families,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV.   Student Loans: Sen. Sanders called a plan floated by Sen. Joe Manchin to tie student loan rates to 10-year Treasury notes “totally insane.” “The American people would laugh at that. It's not a proposal,” he elaborated. Sanders added that the administration’s push for a market-based student loan rate is also a nonstarter, according to The Hill. “The White House’s proposal is absurd as well.”   Dental Care: While visiting Richford, Vt., last week, Sen. Sanders stopped into the Northern Tier Center for Health (NOTCH) clinic to discuss one of his favorite issues – dental care. "We talk about health care, but we have not paid anywhere near enough attention to dental care," Sanders told the St. Albans Messenger.  Immigration Reform: All eyes are on the House of Representatives after the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill in June. The bipartisan vote came after the Senate adopted an amendment to massively bolster border security and added a provision by Sen. Sanders that would create a youth jobs program funded by an additional $10 fee per worker charged to employers that hire foreign workers, Bloomberg BNA reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Student Loans: Sen. Bernie Sanders is continuing to push for moving the interest rate on federal student loans back to 3.4 percent, reversing a doubling to 6.8 percent as of July 1. Speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Sanders read excerpts from emails from Vermonters who were either still in school or out in the workforce and struggling to pay off their loans. Emily Decker from Colchester said her student loan payments were causing her to put off starting a family until her finances are on a better footing. Champlain College student Andrea Craft wrote that she worries the loan repayments will block her from getting ahead once she’s out of school, The Associated Press and U.S. News & World Report.  Youth Jobs: Sen. Sanders told The Washington Post he remains concerned about guest worker provisions in the comprehensive immigration reform bill. H1-B visa expansion would allow hundreds of thousands of foreign laborers to enter the United States, taking jobs away from American workers. The Senate-passed bill includes a youth-employment program proposed by Sanders that would provide 400,000 jobs for young people.  Climate Change: Top White House adviser Heather Zichal met with Senate Democrats Tuesday to discuss President Barack Obama's plans to address climate change, reported Energy Wire. Sen. Sanders said he was not satisfied with the level of ambition shown by the White House on climate change. "They are doing something," he said of the White House. "But when you have a planetary crisis, you've got to be extremely bold. And so that means for a start you have to say, of course we're not going to build the Keystone pipeline. Of course we need a tax on carbon, of course we need a major investment in energy efficiency."   Food Labels: Nearly half of the nation’s state legislatures have introduced bills to require manufacturers to label foods containing genetically modified or genetically engineered products. In addition to Vermont, other states include Washington, Oregon, Connecticut and Maine. Luckily, support for Vermont extends into Washington, D.C., where Sen. Sanders has been a loud proponent of GMO labeling,” according to a Brattleboro Reformer editorial.

'Struggling to Survive' with Student Loans:  Responding to more than 700 emails from college students and graduates in Vermont and around the nation, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called for restoring student the loan interest rate to the level that was charged before the rate doubled on July 1 to 6.8 percent. “We have a major crisis in our country today in terms of the high cost of college and the incredible debt burden that college students and their families are facing,” Sanders said in a Senate floor speech. “Our job is to improve that situation, to lessen the burden on students and their families – not to make it worse.” Sanders read from some of the emails he received about how student loans have affected people’s careers and families.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  F-35s: The South Burlington City Council on Monday voted 3-2 to endorse having F-35s replace the Vermont Air National Guard’s aging F-16 fleet. Winooski officials voted unanimously to postpone discussion of an official response until Wednesday. Vermont’s congressional delegation, Gov. Peter Shumlin and Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger support basing F-35s in Vermont, the Burlington Free Press reported.   Youth Day Camps: Sen. Bernie Sanders discussed important issues concerning young Americans during a visit last Wednesday to a Northern Tier Center for Health (NOTCH) day camp, the St. Albans Messenger reported. Sanders said the day camps are cost-effective investments. They offer students a place to learn and eat a free meal each day during six weeks of summer.   Veterans Home: Congress failed to reauthorize a work-study program which allowed students to work at retirement homes for veterans. Sixty-five veteran college students were forced to leave their part-time jobs at a facility in San Diego as a result of congressional inaction before a June 30 deadline, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune. Sen. Sanders introduced legislation to reauthorize the program, which employed 10,000 young veterans nationwide in the last fiscal year.   Gay Marriage: Sen. Sanders and 21 Democratic senators jumped onto a letter urging Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to permit gay Americans to sponsor their foreign spouses for green cards. The letter was a response to last month’s Supreme Court decision to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage, Roll Call reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Voting Rights: Several Republican-led states have rushed to capitalize on the Supreme Court's recent rejection of a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the court ruling “turned back the clock on equality in America by striking down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act” and added that “the law is as necessary today as it was in the era of Jim Crow laws,” according to The Huffington Post.    Cabinet Confirmations: Several executive branch nominees sailed through the Senate in late June but a protracted fight is expected as Congress returns over other nominations by President Barack Obama. Last month, Anthony Foxx, the former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., was confirmed 100-0 as secretary of transportation and Chicago businesswoman Penny Pritzker was confirmed 97-1 as the new commerce secretary. “We need a secretary of commerce who will represent the interests of working Americans and their families, not simply the interests of CEOs and large corporations,” Sen. Sanders said according to Congressional Quarterly.   Lawmakers Return to Face Immigration, Student Loans: With their August recess only a month away, lawmakers return to Washington with a debate raging over immigration reform, student-loan interest rates still unsettled, and little sign of progress toward a budget deal, National Journal reported. House Republicans will hold a closed-door meeting on immigration Wednesday that could help chart a path after the Senate passed its sweeping immigration-reform bill last month. With differences still apparent on major issues like a path to citizenship, House Speaker John Boehner has refused to commit to the House taking up major immigration legislation prior to Congress's August break.   Wet Weather: Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be in Vermont this week to assess damage from recent flooding in various parts of the state. The FEMA team will be making stops in Chittenden, Washington and Windsor counties on Tuesday — and may add Lamoille and other counties to the list, depending on what the weather does between now and then, according to AP.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Student Loans: Lawmakers may restore lower rates on student loans when they return this week. As of last Monday, the rate doubled to 6.8 percent, which is higher than most loans available from private lenders. “Where are the advocates? I've interviewed Bernie Sanders who says big banks get money at three quarters of a percent,” Ed Schultz said Saturday on MSNBC.   Brunch with Bernie: Every Friday, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Thom Hartmann team up for an hour of Hartmann’s show that they’ve dubbed “Brunch With Bernie.” Listeners from around the country call in to speak one on one with the independent senator, something Sanders said he has enjoyed doing since they started the feature several years ago. “I’m a big fan of Thom’s,” Sanders told Politico.

Must Read: Jobs figures underscore work yet to do - Dan Balz, Washington Post  The reaction to Friday’s jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is the latest example of a nation with lowered economic expectations.  On its face, the report offered good news. The economy added 195,000 jobs in June and beat the forecasters’ estimates. The private sector added 202,000 jobs, while governments — state, local and federal — cut back by just 7,000. The government also revised upward the jobs numbers for the two previous months.  Over the first half of the year, the economy has added 1.2 million jobs to the workforce, an average of about 200,000 a month. Over the past 12 months, 2.3 million jobs have been added.  That is steady progress — and only the latest evidence of an economic recovery that is moving forward month by month. It was greeted as such, taken as a sign that the Federal Reserve might begin to taper off its monetary stimulus for the economy early this fall.  But other numbers from Friday tell a less positive story. Despite the growth in jobs, the unemployment rate held steady at 7.6 percent, because more people were looking for work than in the previous month. And 332,000 people said they were working part-time because of economic conditions, rather than by choice. At the same time, long-term unemployment remains acute. Of the 11.8 million unemployed workers, more than 4.3 million have been out of work for 27 weeks or more.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  J-1 Visas: Wisconsin’s congressional delegation voiced support for J-1 visa programs which would be expanded under new immigration reform legislation, reported Wisconsin Dells Events. Sen. Bernie Sanders has rallied against the programs, which would displace Americans with foreign temporary workers.  True Claim: After PolitiFact rated Sen. Sanders' claim that "nearly 6 out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed" true, one reader asked why tax increases automatically meant a redistribution of wealth. Politico "failed to define just how increasing taxes on higher income people will redistribute wealth," according to the reader.  Republicans and Global Warming: President Barack Obama announced a plan to curb climate change escalation, but Congress remains stalled on the issue, according to Responding to Climate Change. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer proposed a $20 per ton carbon tax on imported goods and fuels. Republicans including Speaker John Boehner flatly rejected that plan.  Brenda Torpy: Brenda Torpy, a former staffer for then-Mayor Bernie Sanders in the 1980's, now leads the Champlain Housing Trust. The largest community housing trust in the world, it provides affordable living for those in need, according to Vermont Public Radio. Her work has been so successful that some worldwide are calling the example the "Burlington model."

The Week in Review:   Interest rates on key federal student loans doubled this week due to congressional inaction. Sen. Bernie Sanders cosponsored legislation to retroactively restore the interest rate back to 3.4 percent. The Senate will take up the issue upon returning from the holiday break. A new study by the Government Accountability Office reported that profitable American companies paid only 12.6 percent of their profits in federal income taxes in 2010. That low number is less than half of the enacted rate of 35 percent. In Burlington, demonstrators gathered at City Hall to protest proposed cuts to Social Security and veterans' benefits. Friday, Department of Labor jobs numbers showed that the United States added 195,000 jobs. Unemployment remained unchanged, while the number of underemployed persons rose.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=F7F99917-E90C-450E-AD24-FC5AE74F3B17
Jobs Crisis:  While the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.6 percent for June, the underemployment rate or “real unemployment,” which includes people who are working part-time because they can’t find a full-time job spiked from 13.8 to 14.3 percent.  While it is good news that employers added 195,000 jobs last month, Sen. Bernie Sanders remains concerned about high unemployment and increasing economic inequality, especially among young people and minorities. “It is absolutely imperative that we create millions of decent-paying jobs in our country,” Sanders said. “In the midst of this slow recovery, we must not accept a ‘new normal.’”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=4281d61c-cb52-4b87-b45e-cf40c4f658ba
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Student Loans: Congress showcased its inability to serve the interests of the people this week, says the Burlington Free Press. Student loan interest rates on key federal loans automatically doubled to 6.8 percent after Congress failed to vote on an extension for lower rates. Sen. Bernie Sanders told the Free Press, "We tell our young people, if you want to make it into the middle class, you have to get a college education." Still, many students cannot afford to attend school.  Citizens United: Oregon adopted a resolution this week to call on Congress to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling with a constitutional amendment, The Huffington Post said. Earlier this year, Sen. Sanders introduced such an amendment in the Senate.   Money in Politics: Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's fame is traveling across the country to encourage activists to fight for campaign finance reform. In Congress, support is growing for a constitutional amendment to reform America's election system. Sen. Sanders is one senator who has been "adamant" about reducing the influence of money in politics, said Cohen in an interview with Slate.  Celebrating the Fourth: Vermonters celebrated the nation's birthday across the state with fireworks and parades, reported Vt. Digger. In Montpelier, Sen. Bernie Sanders was in attendance for the annual July 3 parade.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=5EDCFCD3-730B-4355-B807-CD5C75015443
The Declaration of Independence:  N CONGRESS, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,  When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1966411C-D417-4B5A-8B22-2A7E398E2AB0

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Corporate Tax Rates: Sen. Sanders weighed in on a Government Accountability Office report on corporate tax rates, condeming the low 12.6 percent effective tax rate for profitable American corporations, reported Politico. “This report clearly shows that many multi-national corporations are paying very little in taxes,” remarked Sanders.

No Cuts to Social Security, No "Chained CPI":   Vermonters rallied at Burlington City Hall this week to protest the adoption of a so-called “chained CPI” which would cut Social Security and veterans' benefits. President Barack Obama included the proposal in his annual budget to reduce the deficit by cutting earned benefits for seniors and veterans. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who founded the Defending Social Security Caucus, said the president's inclusion of a chained CPI in his budget was "a huge mistake."  Instead, Sanders wants to implement what President Obama proposed when he was a presidential candidate in 2008: Lifting the cap on Social Security payroll taxes to make the wealthy contribute the same percentage of their income as other workers. “Today, someone making $10 million a year contributes the same amount of money as someone making $113,700. That is absurd,” Sanders said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who also attended the rally, praised Sanders for having the “strongest, most consistent voice” in the fight to strengthen Social Security.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=86bee0ef-6d2e-440c-844c-2ede2e5660aa

Must Read: Big Lie: America Doesn't Have #1 Richest Middle-Class in the World... We're Ranked 27th! - By Les Leopold, The Huffington Post  America is the richest country on Earth. We have the most millionaires, the most billionaires and our wealthiest citizens have garnered more of the planet's riches than any other group in the world. We even have hedge fund managers who make in one hour as much as the average family makes in 21 years!  This opulence is supposed to trickle down to the rest of us, improving the lives of everyday Americans. At least that's what free-market cheerleaders repeatedly promise us.  Unfortunately, it's a lie, one of the biggest ever perpetrated on the American people.  Our middle class is falling further and further behind in comparison to the rest of the world. We keep hearing that America is number one. Well, when it comes to middle-class wealth, we're number 27.

Jacob Childerson, 24, and his wife, Jennifer, 25, wish they could start a family, but they live with Jennifer's parents.  What's holding them all back: tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. Like countless Millennials across the country, they find themselves tethered to that debt load, stuck between the desire to become fully independent adults and not being able to afford the financial and cultural milestones traditionally associated with young adulthood.

Congress is expected to debate the matter after this week's holiday recess.

Bernie Sanders said he believes there should be a vote after the Senate’s holiday recess to restore lower rates retroactively, Yahoo! News reported.

Adjusted for inflation, tuition has increased more than 50 percent since 1999, spurring students to take on crushing loads of debt. It’s set to get worse on July 1 when, barring a congressional deal, the rate charged on federally subsidized Stafford loans will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Immigration: The Senate set a pivotal vote for later today to end debate on a border-security amendment that is expected to bring reluctant Republicans on board for an immigration bill. The same amendment would add language sought by Sen. Bernie Sanders to help young Americans find jobs.

The New York Times said Sanders and at least half a dozen Democrats remain undecided.

Dubrow wrote in a letter to the editor of the Bennington Banner.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C5CE33F2-98CC-44AC-A856-941CFE3F23E4
Today the J-1 program has morphed into a low-wage jobs program to allow corporations like Hershey's and McDonald's and many others to replace young American workers with cheaper labor from abroad.   Watch Sen. Sanders speech here: http://youtu.be/yZz7DYCfM_s
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Immigration Scam: Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to limit guest worker programs in the immigration reform bill that the Senate is debating. Employers who hire students through what began as a cultural exchange but morphed into a summer-work program do not have to first offer the job to an American worker. Businesses also save money because they don't have to pay unemployment taxes, Medicare or Social Security, USA Today reported. "This program is a scam," Sanders said. "It is not a cultural-exchange program. It is displacing young American workers at a time of double-digit employment among young people."   Senate Confirms: Trade Rep Michael Froman, a senior White House economic adviser and law school classmate of President Obama, won Senate confirmation Wednesday to be the next U.S. trade representative. Voting against Froman were the independent Sen. Sanders and three Democrats, The Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, National Journal and Agence France Presse reported.  Energy Efficiency: Sens. Sanders and Ron Wyden plan to introduce legislation to fund residential energy efficiency loans to retrofit homes, according to Congressional Quarterly. Wyden pushed Wednesday for the Congressional Budget Office to include projected savings from future energy bills in its evaluation of energy efficiency bills.   Student Loan Debt: Vermont students have an average of $28,860 in debt, among the highest in the country, and Sen. Sanders wants Congress to stop the automatic doubling of student loan rates on July 1, according to AP, the Burlington Free Press, Times Argus, WCAX-TV, WPTZ-TV, Vermont Public Radio and WAMC-FM.

Must Read: Keep Meals on Wheels going - By Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), POLITICO:   If a nation were judged by how well it cares for its weakest and most vulnerable citizens, the United States would not get high marks.  In America today, while the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well, poverty among seniors is increasing and nearly half of all seniors are now unable to afford their basic living expenses, according to a recent study from the Economic Policy Institute. Four million seniors live on less than $11,000 a year, and 8 million seniors face the threat of hunger. Tragically, according to the AARP Foundation, the number of hungry seniors in the U.S. more than doubled from 2001 to 2009. As distressing as these national statistics are, poverty and hunger are even worse for older women, minorities and those living in rural communities.  One of the most effective programs devised to address the needs of vulnerable seniors is the Older Americans Act. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 along with the better-known Medicare and Medicaid programs. In an extremely cost-effective way, this program is providing high-quality nutrition to more than 1 million frail and isolated older adults through the Meals on Wheels program. It also provides subsidized meals at senior centers throughout the country and employment opportunities for low-income older Americans.  This is a program that not only works well in easing isolation, hunger and suffering, it also saves taxpayers substantial sums of money. Not surprisingly, seniors who are malnourished are more likely to suffer serious illnesses, to break hips because of a fall or, for a variety of reasons, end up in hospital emergency rooms at great expense. To my mind, it makes a lot more sense to provide adequate nutrition to frail seniors than to spend money on preventable hospital costs. The simple truth is, we can feed a senior for an entire year for the cost of one day in a hospital. Further, a Brown University study determined that providing adequate nutrition reduces the need for nursing home care, which costs $80,000 per year.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Meals on Wheels: “One of the most effective programs devised to address the needs of vulnerable seniors is the Older Americans Act … [but] this vitally important program has been inadequately funded for years,” Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a Politico op-ed published Wednesday. The program that provides Meals on Wheels and other support for seniors “deserves not only to be fully reauthorized but to be expanded,” Sanders said. A subcommittee he chairs holds a hearing today on renewing the law first passed in 1965.   Student Loans: Sen. Sanders said a new report shows that the average student loan debt of college students in Vermont is higher than the amount in all but six other states. He said the study showed the need for legislation to prevent the doubling of interest rates to 6.8 percent next month on some Stafford student loans, The Associated Press reported. In a statement, the senator said "short term, we need to make certain rates don't go up this summer. Long term, we need to figure out a way to make college more affordable," WPTZ-TV reported.   NSA Surveillance: National Security Agency officials testified Tuesday on Capitol Hill about secret domestic surveillance programs. General Keith Alexander, the NSA director, claimed more than 50 attacks were stopped using the controversial surveillance programs. Sweeping up the telephone records of every innocent American goes too far, Sen. Sanders told MSNBC. "If they believe somebody is involved in terrorist activity, we want them to be able to go after that guy in any way they can, but you can't have a blanket system in which every single phone call in America is in the government file." On NBC Radio News, Sanders asked, “Are we comfortable with the government having that much information. I think most Americans are not.”   VA Claims Backlog: The VA announced that the amount of time veterans must wait to receive benefits is decreasing, but members of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs – especially Chairman Sanders and Sen. Richard Blumenthal – seemed skeptical, according to the news blog PolicyMic.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=83FB4A70-9155-4D51-9CE9-A24720C557B2
VIDEO: NSA Snooping: http://youtu.be/s4jdE3fks1Q
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Guest Workers: Sen. Bernie Sanders remains concerned about controversial guest-worker programs in the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform package, reported The Hill. Sanders on Monday introduced an amendment to ensure that American corporations cannot exploit foreign exchange students as cheap laborers to replace young American workers. National Review said Sanders has opposed "corporate welfare" provisions in the bill and proposed funding youth jobs programs to curb the economic desire for cheap foreign workers.   NSA Snooping: Vermont's congressional delegation is seeking greater transparency and heightened safeguards for the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance programs, the Burlington Free Press reported. Sen. Sanders introduced legislation to curb the federal government's powers to secretly track data on millions of Americans without first proving reasonable suspicion. “The issue is not complicated. I think everybody understands that we've got to do everything we can to protect the American people from international terrorism, which is a real threat. On the other hand, you can do that without collecting the phone records of hundreds of millions of Americans,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV and New England Cable News.   Fighting for Workers: The “spokesperson for the working folk of America,” is how syndicated radio host Ed Schultz described Sen. Sanders in an interview that aired on Monday about the career of the longest serving independent in the history of Congress. “To be frank with you, Ed, it never occurred to me in a million years that I would be elected to the Senate.”  Dairy Farms: The Dairy Security Act, which would empower a dairy farmer to respond to market signals when determining how much milk to produce, holds the key to the future of family-owned dairy farms in Vermont and across the country. “I am fighting side by side with Vermont’s dairy farmers, along with Sens. Leahy and Sanders, to pass this bill. It’s an uphill battle, but it’s a fight well worth having,” Rep. Peter Welch wrote in the Burlington Free Press and Times Argus.

Summer Jobs:  The Senate on Monday resumed consideration of an immigration reform bill. An amendment proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders would stop employers from using a cultural exchange program to exploit foreign college students and take jobs away from young American workers.  The Summer Work Travel program brings as many as 109,000 foreign university students to the United States each year to work for up to four months. The so-called J-1 program lets foreign college students work in national parks and as waiters, desk clerks, lifeguards and other jobs that used to be performed by American high school and college students.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Domestic Spying: The National Security Agency has compiled phone records of tens of millions of Americans as part of an effort to find links to terrorist operations. Sen. Bernie Sanders said the surveillance law gives the government too much authority. He wants the federal government to prove that the records of a specific individual deserve to be examined. “I want the government to be able to go after that person, but I do not want to see records of hundreds of millions of Americans assembled by the United States government,” Sanders told Vermont Public Radio in a report broadcast on Monday.“  Domestic Spying: “An administration run by supposed liberals thinks that it's ok for government to secretly seize phone and Internet records of citizens, without the kind of explicit search warrant contemplated by the Fourth Amendment. The conservatives who controlled the federal government in the Bush administration were even more cavalier about trampling citizen rights. You have to go to the libertarian right (Rand Paul) and the progressive left (Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley) to find support for containing the national security state,” Robert Kutner wrote for The American Prospect and The Huffington Post.   Restore Our Privacy: Sen. Sanders introduced the "Restore Our Privacy Act," which would put strict limits on the NSA and the FBI's controversial powers to spy on innocent Americans, Thom Hartmann reported on Truth Out. "We must give our intelligence and law enforcement agencies all of the tools that they need to combat terrorism, but we must do so in a way that protects our freedom and respects the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches,” Sanders said. Hartmann added, “There is no justification for spying on the personal emails and phone records of millions of Americans. Thankfully, we have Sen. Sanders to stand up to the intelligence agencies and demand that our right of privacy be fully restored.”   Food Labels: Sen. Sanders called out Monsanto for killing his amendment that would have given states the power require GMOs to be labeled on our food, according to a Politicus summary of a Saturday interview on MSNBC. “My amendment said if California, Vermont, Connecticut, other states want to go forward, they should have the right. What we know is that all over Europe. We’ve got dozens and dozens of countries which do label GMO products. We should be able to do that in the United States as well.”   Continue to read here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=E9411141-A427-4D9B-9FBF-57980E2D9F60

Sign here to support the Restore Our Privacy Act: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/petition/?uid=a81ea8d9-7ee0-477d-b03e-0c790a6b9aa6  What this bill does:   - Reforms Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act (50 U.S.C. 1861) to limit the ability of the government to engage in dragnet data mining.   - Requires that the NSA or FBI have reasonable suspicion, based on specific and articulable facts, to obtain business records for a terrorism suspect.   - Ends the process of obtaining wide-open orders for data mining; the government would be required to provide reasonable suspicion for each tangible thing to be obtained. Removes the presumption that anyone "known to" a suspect is relevant to the investigation.   - Increases Congressional oversight-the Attorney General shall be required to report to the Congress as a whole, not just the members of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Poverty in America: With poverty in the United States at an almost 50-year high, Sen. Bernie Sanders said safety net programs that provide food for children and retirement and health care for the elderly must be protected. During an interview Saturday on The Ed Show on MSNBC, Sanders also called for a building program to create jobs repairing America’s crumbling roads and bridges and transforming our energy systems. “Let’s be clear. Most of the families that receive food stamps have kids. Most working people would rather have a paycheck than be on food stamps,” Sanders said.   NSA Claims it Stopped 20 Plots: Top U.S. intelligence officials said Saturday that information gleaned from two controversial data-collection programs run by the National Security Agency thwarted potential terrorist plots in the U.S. and more than 20 other countries — and that gathered data is destroyed every five years. Last year, fewer than 300 phone numbers were checked against the database of millions of U.S. phone records gathered daily by the NSA. No other new details about the plots or the countries involved were part of the newly declassified information released on Saturday and made public by the Senate Intelligence Committee, The Associated Press reported.   Senators Challenge NSA Claims: Before Saturday’s release of declassified documents, two prominent Senate critics of the NSA's dragnet surveillance challenged the agency's assertion that the spy efforts helped stop "dozens" of terror attacks. Mark Udall and Ron Wyden, both members of the Senate intelligence committee, said they were not convinced by the testimony of the NSA director, General Keith Alexander, on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, who claimed that evidence gleaned from surveillance helped thwart attacks in the US. "We have not yet seen any evidence showing that the NSA's dragnet collection of Americans' phone records has produced any uniquely valuable intelligence," they said in a statement released on Thursday ahead of a widely anticipated briefing for US senators about the National Security Agency's activities, The Guardian reported.   NSA Spying Resurrected: In 2004, acting attorney general James B. Comey and the Justice Department’s top leadership reached the brink of resignation over electronic surveillance orders that they believed to be illegal. President George W. Bush backed down, halting secret foreign-intelligence-gathering operations that had crossed into domestic terrain. That morning marked the beginning of the end of four surveillance programs that brought Americans and American territory within the domain of the National Security Agency for the first time in decades. It was also a prelude to new legal structures that allowed Bush and then President Obama to reproduce each of those programs and expand their reach, according to The Washington Post.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Restoring Our Privacy: Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to curb the government's widespread secret domestic surveillance programs, reported Politico, WCAX-TV, United Press International, Fox News Radio and PoliticusUSA. The legislation requires federal agencies to demonstrate reasonable suspicion in order to obtain surveillance court warrants. “In a free democratic society, you should be able to make a telephone call to anyone you want without believing that the United States government has that information.” Sen. Sanders said on The Thom Hartmann Program Friday.  Domestic Surveillance: Vermont's congressional delegation remains concerned about the widespread spying programs. "As one of the few members of Congress who consistently voted against the Patriot Act, I expressed concern at the time of passage that it gave the government far too much power to spy on innocent United State citizens and provided for very little oversight or disclosure. Unfortunately, what I said turned out to be exactly true,” Sen. Sanders was quoted in the Valley News.  NSA Briefings: Senators received classified briefings from National Security Agency officials this week after revelations shed light on two secret surveillance programs, reported. Some senators emerged from the briefing with positive comments about the administration's new transparency efforts on Capitol Hill. Critics of the surveillance programs remain concerned. “They have not done a particularly good job in explaining it to the American people,” Sen. Sanders told Politico.  Immigration Reform: With the Senate expected to vote on a far-reaching immigration bill by early July, supporters are stepping up their courtship of the many lawmakers who remain publicly undecided. Efforts to address the concerns of the holdouts will shape the next two weeks of action in the Senate. Sen. Sanders opposed a 2007 immigration bill and worries proposed guest-worker programs could harm Americans, but he supports many other aspects of the current Senate bill, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.

The Week in Review:   There was more fallout from the disclosure of a massive telephone and Internet surveillance program. The data harvesting operation of heretofore unknown scope tracked the calls and keystrokes of tens of millions of innocent Americans. Fifty-eight percent of Americans disapprove of this type of data collection in the case of ordinary Americans, according to a poll for CBS News. “I believe that most Americans do not want to live in an Orwellian society, where everything you do is recorded," Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a reference to George Orwell’s “1984.” Sanders introduced legislation on Thursday that would give intelligence and law enforcement officials the authority they need to ferret out terrorists without violating the rights of innocent Americans. On Capitol Hill, the Senate on Monday passed a farm bill. On Tuesday, an immigration reform bill was on the floor for a debate expected to last throughout June.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Spying on Americans: Lawmakers who have consistently warned about the collection of Americans' telephone data remain troubled by other aspects of the government's surveillance programs that remain secret. They are pressing the administration to release information on the legal rationales for its sweeping collection powers and how it is using any stored data obtained from Americans as part of its counterterrorism efforts. The Washington Post said lawmakers from the right and the left have questioned the government's exercise of its powers, including Sens. Bernard Sanders, Richard J. Durbin and Mike Lee.  Domestic Surveillance: “What I worry about,” Sen. Sanders said Thursday on The Ed Show, “is kids growing up in a society in which they say ‘If I send this email or if I visit this website then somebody may think I’m a terrorist. I don’t want anyone thinking about that. I’m not going to talk about this issue, I’m not going to read this book, I’m not going to explore this idea’ … It upsets me very much and is not the kind of free, vigorous society where people are tossing out ideas or exploring ideas without fear that I think we should be living in.”  Immigration: Senate Democratic leaders with long records of supporting labor unions, gay rights and gun restrictions, are ready to vote against these constituencies to win passage of an immigration law, but they may have to contend with Sen. Sanders and other lawmakers who aren't pleased with changes to the bill made by the Judiciary Committee. In an interview at the Capitol, Sanders told Bloomberg News that he would work with the AFL-CIO and lawmakers "to come up with sensible guest-worker programs, which do not result in more unemployment for American workers."  Global Warming: Sen. Sanders' carbon tax bill will be considered next month by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, reported The Hill. Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer said she wants to move the bill to the floor this summer.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=CD3D6595-F38B-4923-BFAD-A1F9B4913588
Sanders Amendment for Young Workers:   The immigration bill now before the Senate would provide a  pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. It would make sure children brought into this country by their parents years ago are allowed to become citizens. It would improve border security. Sen. Bernie Sanders supports all of that. He opposes, however,  provisions in the bill that would allow a massive increase in temporary guest worker programs. The way the legislation is worded now would let large corporations import hundreds of thousands of temporary blue collar and white collar guest workers from overseas.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   VA Backlog: A Department of Veterans' Affairs official told a Senate committee Wednesday that the VA reached a "tipping point" in its efforts to reduce a staggering veterans' claims backlog, The Washington Post reported. The VA previously set a goal that all claims would be solved within 125 days with a 98 percent accuracy rate by the end of 2015. “I honestly believe we're going to meet that goal, a senior VA official told Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders at a hearing on Wednesday.   Immigration Reform: Sen. Sanders told Vermont Public Radio the legislation contains some important elements, but he’s concerned that the bill expands a guest worker program that allows U.S. companies to bring foreign workers into this country for high tech jobs and positions in the tourist industry. “I worry very much that many of these very large corporations are putting a lot of energy into this bill in trying to keep wages down and instead of raising wages to attract American workers,” Sanders said. Sanders remains a “maybe” vote on the bill, reported Seven Days.    Left and Right: Revelations of massive government collections of Americans’ phone and email records have reinvigorated an odd-couple political alliance of the far left and right, according to the Burlington Free Press. “I want our law enforcement people to be vigorous in going after terrorists,” Sen. Sanders said in the AP article. “But I happen to believe they can do that without disregarding the Constitution.”   1984: Sales of George Orwell's classic '1984' spiked this week after two National Security Agency surveillance programs were exposed. United Press International and Alabama Media reported that Sen. Sanders mentioned the author in a recent interview, saying he feared America's move toward an "Orwellian society."

Must Read: Why I Don't Care About Edward Snowden - Ron Fournier, National Journal:   Is Edward Snowden a hero or a traitor? I don't care. You read right: I don't give a whit about the man who exposed two sweeping U.S. online surveillance programs, nor do I worry much about his verdict in the court of public opinion.  Why? Because it is the wrong question. The Snowden narrative matters mostly to White House officials trying to deflect attention from government overreach and deception, and to media executives in search of an easy storyline to serve a celebrity-obsessed audience.  For the rest of us, the questions seem to be:  Are the two programs revealed by Snowden legal and constitutional?  What else is the government doing to invade our privacy? Until a few days ago, paranoids were people who claimed Washington had cast a vast electronic net over our communications. Who isn't a bit paranoid now?  Why did the U.S. government for years debunk what they called a myth about the National Security Agency seizing electronic data from millions of Americans?  Why did the leader of the U.S. intelligence community mislead Congress in March by answering a question about the program in the "least untruthful manner" -- a phrase that would make George Orwell cringe.  Why do Democratic lawmakers who criticized President Bush for exploiting the post-9/11 Patriot Act now defend President Obama for curbing civil liberties?  Why do Republicans who defended Bush now chastise Obama for ruthlessly fighting terrorists?  Rather than fierce oversight, why did the White House and congressional leaders restrict full knowledge of the programs to a few elites, and stage, for the rest of Congress, Potemkin briefings? Why does a secret federal court almost always side with the government's requests to seize information?  Why didn't the president find a way before the leaks to tell the public in general terms what he was doing and why? Obama ran on a pledge of government transparency, opposed Bush-era surveillance tactics, and denounced the "false choice" between security and liberty.

Claims Backlog Shrinking, VA Says:   There are some 851,000 veterans awaiting answers on compensation claims for illnesses or injuries incurred during their service. Two-thirds of the claims have been waiting more than 125 days for an answer. The Department of Veterans Affairs says that number finally has begun to decline. There has been “significant progress” and VA is “at a tipping point” in reducing a massive backlog of claims, Thomas Murphy, the VA’s director of compensation services, told Chairman Bernie Sanders during testimony Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. Murphy said the backlog is shrinking and on track to meet VA Secretary Eric Shinseki’s goal of processing all claims within 125 days with 98 percent accuracy by the end of 2015. “I honestly believe we’re going to hit that number,” Murphy said. While the caseload decline is encouraging, Sanders said there is still much to be done so that VA can meet its goal of eliminating the claims backlog. “The current backlog is unacceptable and this committee will do everything possible to make sure the VA achieves its goal. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely,” Sanders said.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=053539B5-0CC6-4799-ABF9-4DDDD2258B4A
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Immigration Reform: Senators voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to take up a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Sen. Sanders supports making it possible for 11 million immigrants to become citizens but remains critical of guest-worker provisions that would allow more foreign workers into the U.S. at a time of high unemployment, according to online reports in The Washington Post, ABC News, Congressional Quarterly and The Huffington Post. “I fear very much that this [visa] program is being exploited by corporations like Hershey's and McDonald's as an effort to simply bring students from abroad to work at low-paying jobs in the United States,” Sanders said.   Domestic Spying: Sen. Sanders, Democratic civil liberties activists and libertarian-leaning Republicans all say the government actions are too broad and don't adequately protect citizens' privacy, according to The Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, The Huffington Post, and The Daily Beast.   1984: George Orwell's famous '1984' has received no shortage of references in the political world as details emerged about secret National Security Agency domestic spying programs, reported ABC News online and The Guardian. In a televised interview on MSNBC Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders said, "I believe that most Americans do not want to live in an Orwellian society, where everything you do is recorded." Sales of the book have skyrocketed.   Keystone XL: Lawsuit Environmental groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing the State Department of withholding key documents related to the latest Keystone XL environmental review, reported The Huffington Post. Sen. Sanders said of the pipeline, "It would be incomprehensible to give approval to a tar sands oil project when producing tar sands oil creates more carbon emissions than conventional oil, and when it poses the risk of extremely damaging oil spills."

Immigration Reform:   The Senate on Tuesday voted to advance an immigration reform bill. The legislation would open the door to citizenship for 11 million people living in the United States. By a vote of 82-15, the bill overcame the first procedural hurdle in a debate expected to last throughout June. Sen. Bernie Sanders supports a path to citizenship and he supports the DREAM Act. He strongly objects, however, to big corporations using the bill as a way to lower wages and benefits for American workers.  “I want to see comprehensive immigration reform passed,” he said, “but at a time when nearly 14 percent of Americans do not have a full-time job and when the middle class is working longer hours for lower wages, I oppose a massive increase in temporary guest worker programs that will allow large corporations to import hundreds of thousands of blue-collar and white-collar workers from overseas.”  Watch the speech here: http://youtu.be/w4h1PVE5alw
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Domestic Spying: Edward J. Snowden said he leaked secret documents about National Security Agency surveillance to spark a public debate about civil liberties. Sen. Dianne Feinstein says what Snowden did was an act of treason, but others on Capitol Hill, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, say the surveillance is too broad and we need to look at scaling back the Patriotic Act, NBC News reported on the early “Today Show” on WPTZ-TV and other affiliates. Sanders said focusing too much on Snowden is a distraction from the more fundamental questions raised by his disclosures. “The question is what freedom and liberty mean in the United States of America? What does our Constitution mean? What kind of country do we want to be?” Sanders told Chris Hayes on MSNBC.   NSA Surveillance: All three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation worry about the new revelations that the National Security Agency accessed the telephone data of millions of Americans and apparently has a dragnet collecting email and other Internet data. Sanders said he wants to amend the Patriot Act “to require the government to prove that it has probable cause before gathering information on any specific individual,” the Burlington Free Press reported.   1984: Sen. Sanders worried about the “Orwellian” future looming for the United States if it continues to record its citizens' activities in the name of national security, The Huffington Post and The Raw Story reported in blogs about what Sanders said on MSNBC. “Welcome to 1984, the book, not the year. Big Brother is officially watching and has been for some time. I urge everyone to call Mr. Leahy, Sanders and Welch, George Diedrich wrote in a letter to the editor of the Times Argus.   Military Sex Assaults: Sen. Sanders will lead a hearing Wednesday on the effects of sexual assaults on veterans while in the military. Sanders said his interest is prompted in part by helping a Maine woman who was raped twice by her Navy commander and later struggled for 23 years to get the disability benefits she had coming, the Rutland Herald reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Youth Unemployment: Sen. Bernie Sanders is in Detroit today to pitch a youth jobs program. Despite recent improvements in national unemployment numbers, Sanders says the jobless rate for young people remains extremely high today. His youth jobs act would provide $3 billion to employ low-income young adults in jobs and skills training. Sanders and Michigan Rep. John Conyers plan to present the program at a Detroit community college, WCAX-TV, WPTZ-TV, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported.  NSA Surveillance: Sen. Sanders said there should be a limit on government security services’ access to phone records and Internet data from large companies such as Google and Facebook. Sanders opposed the renewal of the Patriot Act in 2011 because he felt it gave the government too much authority to monitor private phone records. He said his worst fears came true last week when it was revealed that the federal government had been secretly obtaining phone and Internet records of millions of people, according to an Associated Press report in the Times Argus and on WPTZ-TV.   NSA Surveillance: Sanders told reporters he’s shocked by the breadth of the program. “I worry what it would mean for American civil liberties, but I will tell you I never ever expected that under any definition of that legislation that it would mean the phone calls of millions and millions of Americans — virtually none of whom the government has any reason to believe is involved in terrorism — would be checked by the United States government,” Sanders said in Politico.   Global Warming: “We need to stop fiddling while the planet burns,” Marilyn Chapman wrote in an op-ed for the Morristown, N.J. Daily Record. She said Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer introduced the Senate bill Climate Protection Act of 2013. This bill intends to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions without unfairly burdening those who have the least means to adapt their energy usage habits and devote a significant percentage of their incomes on energy.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Food Labels: The Vermont House last month became the first to pass a bill requiring labeling of food with genetically modified organisms, followed weeks later by the Connecticut Senate. In Washington, Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced an amendment to guarantee states the right to require labeling on any food or beverage containing GMOs, but it failed. “When you deal with companies like Monsanto, the biotech industry and large food, you’re taking on very powerful special interests and they will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent labeling,” “Sanders told the Burlington Free Press.   NSA Spying: President Barack Obama defended National Security Agency surveillance programs, saying they are designed to promote public safety and protect civil liberties. Civil libertarians raised questions about the scope and risks of the programs. "The bottom line is that we have to defend ourselves from terrorism, but we don't have to do it in a way that allows the government to accumulate information on literally tens of millions of innocent Americans," said Sen. Sanders in a Gannett News Service report published by The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun and other newspapers.  NSA Spying: Sen. Sanders and other critics of the surveillance program said the intelligence community and leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee “are overstating just how much members of Congress were briefed,” Alex Bolton of The Hill said on Saturday on MSNBC. “They say that lawmakers outside the intelligence committees had only broad indications what these programs were about but didn’t know that so many Americans were being swept up in these data sweeps."   Lake Champlain: The Leahy Environmental Summit … was important if for no other reason than hearing the opening remarks delivered by Sen. Sanders, Rep. Welch, Gov. Shumlin and Sen. Leahy, who all underscored the importance of Lake Champlain to Vermont’s natural heritage, economy and way of life,” Chris Kilian wrote in the Burlington Free Press.

Is it appropriate for the federal government to collect millions of phone records from American citizens, if doing so could potentially disrupt a terror plot? Weigh in here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/polls/
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Defends Surveillance: President Barack Obama publicly acknowledged the government's electronic sleuthing on its citizens that he justified as a way to protect Americans from terrorism. His comments on Friday came in response to media reports that detailed the government's secret mass collection of phone and Internet communications. “I don’t accept the excuses from the administration,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said during a radio interview Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. “We expected better from the Obama people.”  Sanders is ‘Deeply Disappointed’: When Congress renewed the Patriot Act in 2011, Sen. Sanders opposed the measure because he felt the law gave the federal government too much authority to monitor private phone records. Sanders told Vermont Public Radio that he is dismayed that President Obama expanded the surveillance program started by former President George W. Bush. “Am I deeply disappointed that Barack Obama, who among other things taught and studied Constitutional law, believes he has the authority or that it makes good public policy to do this? Am I disappointed? Absolutely."  NSA Fallout: Sen. Sanders voiced concern that the government has overstepped its bounds by tracking phone records and electronic communications for hundreds of millions of people, ABC News reported online. Sanders called for reviewing a controversial section of the Patriot Act, according to The Hill, and said his prior warnings about the Patriot Act “turned out exactly to be true,” according to CNN, The Week and U.S. News and World Report. While the nation must guard against terrorists, Sanders said “we don't have to do it in a way that allows the government to accumulate information on literally tens of millions of innocent Americans,” reported MSNBC, USA Today and Congressional Quarterly.  NSA Fallout Overseas: In Syria and other conflict zones on Friday, activists and militants with diverse politics expressed collective outrage over American data mining. Taliban fighters and Qaeda operatives found themselves on the same side of a debate as human rights activists, privacy advocates and conservative civil libertarians, according to The New York Times. It said Iran's semiofficial Mehr News Agency quoted Sen. Sanders saying, ''The United States should not be accumulating phone records on tens of millions of innocent Americans."

The Week in Review:   The National Security Agency collected records on tens of millions of innocent telephone and Internet customers in the United States for the past seven years, the Obama administration acknowledged Thursday after The Guardian and The Washington Post revealed details of the classified effort. Sen. Bernie Sanders said authorities need tools to fight real threats by terrorists, but he called for changes in the Patriot Act, a domestic spying bill which he voted against. President Obama defended the surveillance program that he inherited from the Bush administration. “I don’t accept the excuses from the administration,” Sanders told Thom Hartmann on Friday during his weekly radio program. “We expected better from the Obama people.” Also on Friday, the Labor Department reported that unemployment in May was 13.8 percent counting workers forced into part-time jobs and those who fell out of the labor force.  With jobs in mind, Sanders on Wednesday spelled out his concerns that an immigration reform bill would cost Americans’ jobs by letting big corporations bring more foreign guest workers to the United States to work for less pay. Overall, the senator stressed, he supports a path to citizenship for 11 million people and their children.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  U.S. Spies on Americans: The debate over whether the U.S. government is violating citizens' privacy rights while trying to protect them from terrorism escalated dramatically on Thursday amid reports that authorities collected data on millions of phone users and tapped into servers at nine Internet companies. “The United States should not be accumulating phone records on tens of millions of innocent Americans,” Sen. Bernie Sander said in reports by Reuters, the Burlington Free Press, Rutland Herald and Times Argus.   NSA Eavesdropping: The reports that the National Security Agency has been collecting phone records from millions of innocent customers sparked outrage. “To simply say in a blanket way that millions and millions of Americans should have their phone records checked by the United States government is indefensible and, to my mind, unacceptable,” said Sen. Sanders in the Fort Worth, Tex., Star-Telegram and other McClatchy newspapers. Sanders, who voted against the Patriot Act when it was first enacted in 2001 and has opposed its reauthorization, said the disclosures demonstrate the government has too much power to spy on Americans. "We've got to revisit the USA Patriot Act," he told USA Today. "We've got to work on legislation to restrict those types of activities."  Sounding the Alarm: There were cryptic but insistent warnings from two Senate Intelligence Committee members who tried to bring to light the scale of government collection of communication information in the name of national security. To some colleagues, the news of the surveillance program was vindication for the two senators. "People like Ron Wyden and Mark Udall have been doing their best to try to talk about it," Sanders told The New York Times. "They've been talking about it as best they could."   Sanders: Surveillance is Unconstitutional: When it was President Bush collecting phone records, a certain senator from Illinois was outraged. “No more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on Americans who are not suspected of a crime,” Sen. Barack Obama said. This time some of President Obama’s own allies are outraged at him. “I think it violates the Constitution of the United States and the heart and soul of America as a free country,” Sen. Sanders told ABC News on World News.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=5B294740-10FE-46B6-89F0-0513E54BA1E7

Alarming and Absolutely Unacceptable: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=19030978-95D7-4C3A-94CA-03ED1D1185B7
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Phone Records: The National Security Agency is currently collecting the telephone records of millions of U.S. customers of Verizon, one of America's largest telecoms providers, under a top secret court order issued in April. The order, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian, requires Verizon on an "ongoing, daily basis" to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the United States and between the U.S. and other countries. The document shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of U.S. citizens are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk – regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.   Immigration: Sen. Bernie Sanders commended “strong components” of an immigration reform bill expected to come before the full Senate next week that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants, but he cautioned that increasing visas for blue-collar and high-tech foreign workers will hurt Americans looking for jobs, WCAX-TV reported. “We do not want to take any action that lowers wages or increases unemployment for American workers,” Sanders said.   Food Labels: Sen. Sanders proposed an amendment to the federal farm bill that would have allowed states to require clear labels on any food or beverage containing ingredients that have been genetically modified. Of the 71 "no" votes, 28 came from Democrats - many of whom, like Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, consider themselves to be consumer advocates and backers of the public's right to know, John Nichols wrote for The (Madison, Wis.) Capital Times. The other 43 "no" votes came from Republicans, like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, almost all of whom say they want to free up the states to experiment and innovate.  Too Big to Fail: Sen. Sanders and Rep. Brad Sherman have introduced legislation that would give the Treasury Department 90 days to identify commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and insurance companies whose “failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy.” Treasury would then be required to break up those institutions, according to In These Times. “No single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world economy into crisis. … If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,” Sanders said.

Senate Panel to Take Up Help for Veterans who were Victims of Military Sex Abuse:   With the Pentagon embroiled in criticism over its handling of sexual assault cases, Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday that veterans who suffered sexual trauma in the military deserve care and compensation.   The House on Tuesday passed legislation expressing a sense of Congress that VA should update regulations for veterans seeking disability compensation for mental health conditions resulting from service-connected military sexual trauma.  Sanders’ committee will consider a companion bill by Sen. Jon Tester of Montana that also is named after Navy veteran Ruth Moore.  A Maine resident who once lived in West Danville, Vt., Moore was raped twice in 1987 by her supervisor in the Navy.  After she left the military, Moore’s life spiraled downward and her marriage ended.  She struggled for 23-years to receive disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Her long battle for benefits finally was successful after she contacted Sanders’ office for help.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Immigration: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday commended a Senate immigration reform bill’s “strong components” and said he supports a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally. He also supports provisions that would help Vermont’s dairy farms and apple orchards that depend on foreign labor. But Sanders said he opposes a “massive increase in temporary guest-worker programs that will allow large multinational corporations to import hundreds of thousands of temporary blue-collar and white-collar workers into this country from overseas,” the Burlington Free Press reported.   House Passes Abuse Claims Bill for Veterans: The House passed legislation Tuesday to recognize sexual assault cases for veterans seeking financial compensation. Named after veteran Ruth Moore, the bill would help veterans with depression and post-traumatic stress due to sexual assaults. Moore’s case was resolved after a 23-year struggle when she sought help from Sen. Sanders, Congressional Quarterly reported.   March against Monsanto: The (St. Crois, Wis.) Sun reported Tuesday that around 50 area residents joined a “March against Monsanto” protest to “inform the greater public of the health risks and environmental concerns associated with genetically modified organisms.” Sen. Sanders introduced an amendment to let states require labels for GMOs, but it failed in the Senate.   Strolling of the Heifers: The 12th annual Strolling of the Heifers parade on Saturday includes scores of colorfully-bedecked heifer calves. After the parade, the heifers and other farm animals will congregate in the shady area at the east end of the Brattleboro Common, where the public is invited to meet them up close. At about 12:15 p.m. at the Commons, Sen. Sanders will join local celebrities in the annual celebrity milking contest, near the bandstand, the Brattleboro Reformer reported.

Immigration Reform:  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday congratulated the Senate Judiciary Committee for drafting an immigration reform bill that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the United States and help their children become citizens. He also supported provisions in the measure that would strengthen border enforcement, prevent unscrupulous employers from hiring illegal workers and give legal status to foreign workers needed to keep Vermont’s dairy farms and apple orchards in business. Sanders, however, expressed strong concern that large American corporations in the midst of very high unemployment were using immigration reform to lower wages and benefits for American workers.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sen. Frank Lautenberg, 89: United States Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat of New Jersey, passed away Monday at the age of 89, reported The (New Jersey) Record. Lautenberg was a World War II veteran, successful businessman, and the oldest member of the Senate. He is survived by his wife, Bonnie; six children and their spouses; and 13 grandchildren.   Immigration: Supporters of an immigration reform bill can’t yet count on the vote of Sen. Bernie Sanders. “There is a lot in the bill that is very good,” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press on Monday, but he added that “what I’m nervous about are some of the guest worker provisions.” Sanders said he hopes the Senate revises provisions in the bill that would make it too easy for businesses to bring in foreign workers at a time when domestic unemployment remains high.   Corporate Taxes: Sen. Sanders’ Corporate Tax Fairness Act to end offshore tax shelters was cited in The Huffington Post by Campaign for America's Future’s Dave Johnson as a “possible solution” to corporate abuse of tax loopholes.   The New Normal: America's economic recovery engendered massive wealth and income transfers to the rich, betrayals from America's corporations and regressive budget cuts, according to a Paul Buchheit blog for Truthout. He cited Sen. Sanders’ assertion that this "new normal" is unacceptable.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1CF9FCA8-F88F-4CF7-BF31-59B9EC4D0481
Saddled with Student Debt:   Just weeks after receiving their diplomas, college graduates are struggling to find jobs to help repay student loans. In Vermont, a typical student has racked up $28,000 in debts after four years in college. Compounding the problem, federal student loan rates are set to double on July 1.  Sen. Bernie Sanders is drafting legislation that would reform how students pay for higher education. He also is working with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who introduced legislation that would ensure students are offered the same loan rates the Fed gives big banks on Wall Street: 0.75 percent.  Watch Sen. Sanders discuss student debt here: http://youtu.be/sJbOXfuuJCA Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1CA3164D-C65C-4765-BEBE-8AB4C66B5AFA
Social Security is Not Going Broke: http://youtu.be/wqcyTo4vI-c
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Social Security: Sen. Bernard Sanders is hailing a new report on the Social Security program as supporting his conclusion the program is not going broke. Trustees of Medicare and Social Security reported Friday the programs have enough money to stay afloat until 2026 in the case of Medicare and 2033 in the case of Social Security, The Associated Press reported.   Social Security: “Social Security can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American over the next 20 years. Despite our right-wing friends’ assertions, Social Security is not going bankrupt. It is not in crisis,” Sen. Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC on Sunday.   Veterans Town Meetings: Sen. Sanders addressed southern Vermont veterans on Saturday in Bennington. He was accompanied by White River Junction Medical Center Director Deb Amdur. They focused on health care. Sanders also held town meetings in White River Junction and Brattleboro, the Bennington Banner reported.   The New Normal: “Significant progress has been made in moving our economy out of the abyss of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, but … we must not accept a ‘new normal’ … in which the middle class continues to disappear, poverty is near an all-time high and the gap between the very rich and everyone else grows wider and wider,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column for The Guardian.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=CB967255-8ECB-4C66-9E5C-83761A6D5E75
We must not accept this economic 'new normal' - Sen. Bernie Sanders:   The front pages of American newspapers are filled with stories about how the US economy is recovering. There is some truth to that. Since President George W Bush left office in 2008, significant progress has been made in moving our economy out of the abyss of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But in the midst of this slow recovery, we must not accept a "new normal".  We must not be content with an economic reality in which the middle class of this country continues to disappear, poverty is near an all-time high and the gap between the very rich and everyone else grows wider and wider.  The good news is that instead of losing more than 700,000 jobs a month as we were five years ago, we've been gaining almost 200,000 jobs a month since January. The bad news is that, in addition to those job numbers being much too low, nearly 60% of the jobs gained since the "recovery" are low-wage jobs that pay less than $14 an hour, while most of the jobs lost during the recession were decent-paying middle-class jobs.  The good news is that the official unemployment rate has gone down from 10% in October of 2009 to 7.5% in April. The bad news is that 20 million Americans still are looking for work and the real unemployment rate – counting those who have given up looking for work and those working part time when they need full time jobs – is 13.9% The very bad news is that youth and minority unemployment is far higher than that and, with the decline in factory jobs, income for poorly educated men has shrunk by nearly two-thirds over the past four decades.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Veterans Town Meeting: Sen. Bernie Sanders, who leads the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, began a tour of VA facilities yesterday in White River Junction, fielding questions and suggestions from veterans, the Valley News, Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported. “This is your VA,” Sanders said. “What makes this institution different than any other is this is yours. To make it work well, we need your ideas.”  Social Security: Sen. Sanders said a new report that the retirement system’s finances will remain strong for at least two more decades was a reason to reject President Obama’s proposal to cut benefits, Lauren Fox of U.S. News & World Report said Saturday on MSNBC.  “Let's not mess with Social Security,” is how she summed up Sanders; stance. “We're on the right track.”   Hemp: The Vermont Legislature passed a bill to allow Vermont farmers to plant hemp as early as this year. Vote Hemp … gives a huge thank-you to the state Legislature …We also thank Sen. Patrick Leahy for recently joining Sen. Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch in his pledged support of federal hemp legislation,” Eric Lineback wrote in an op-ed for the Rutland Herald.

Sanders Statement on Social Security Trust Fund Report: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=58a9761e-7a01-49b4-92b6-70b7c77afd96
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Social Security: Social Security can pay all benefits owed to all eligible recipients until 2033, according to a report by the retirement system’s trustees issued Friday. Critics of President Barack Obama’s proposal to cut benefits said the report reaffirmed that the retirement program is sustainable for decades. “The report from the Social Security trustees confirms what many of us have known, that Social Security is not ‘going broke,’ that it can pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 20 years,” Sen. Bernard Sanders said in Congressional Quarterly and Politicus USA.   Social Security: Sen. Sanders argued against Obama's proposal to limit future cost-of-living increases by applying a less-generous measure of inflation. Instead, Sanders said the report showed the wealthy should pay more into the pension program, Reuters reported. "We must lift the cap on Social Security payroll taxes and make the wealthy contribute the same percentage of their income as other workers," he said. "Today, someone making $10 million a year contributes the same amount of money as someone making $113,700. That is absurd."   Veterans: Sen. Sanders will hold a town meeting today in Brattleboro to discuss veterans issues with Deb Amdur, director of the White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Brattleboro Reformer noted.

The Week in Review:   Medicare's hospital trust fund will not be exhausted until 2026, two years later than projected only last year, according to a report released on Friday. Social Security can pay all benefits owed to every eligible recipient until 2033, the retirement systems’ trustees said on Friday. Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to strengthen Social Security for generations to come by making the wealthy contribute the same share of their income as everyone else There was mixed news on the economy. Home sales and consumer confidence are up, according to reports released on Tuesday. By Thursday, however, came word from the Commerce Department that economic growth in the first quarter was sluggish. That same day brought news that the typical American household has regained only 45 percent of its wealth since the recession began.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Tax Breaks for the Rich: Tax breaks will put $12 trillion into the bank accounts of mostly wealthy Americans over the next decade, according to a new study by the Congressional Budget Office. Seventeen percent of the total tax breaks would go to families earning roughly $450,000 or more. “They’re going to have to pay their fair share of taxes because we are not going to balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable people in this country,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told syndicated radio host Ed Schultz on Thursday.   Memorial Day: A ceremony was held Thursday at the Vermont Veterans Cemetery to remember those who have died serving our country. Adjutant General Steven Cray of the Vermont National Guard, Sen. Sanders and Lt. Gov. Phil Scott addressed the crowd. Each of them called upon Vermonters to do something in their lives that would honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice. More than three dozen service members with Vermont ties have been Killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, WCAX-TV reported.  Veterans: Sen. Sanders will host meetings this Saturday in White River Junction, Brattleboro and Bennington to explain benefits available to veterans. Sanders, an independent and chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said there are new health care and other benefits available, but many veterans are not yet aware of them, the Bennington Banner reported.   Food Labels: Sen. Sanders worries that Monsanto or other companies like it may try to sue states that require GMO labeling. He proposed federal legislation that would protect states against lawsuits. That legislation did not go anywhere, but Sanders said neither has his resolve to inform Americans about what went into their food. "We're going to continue this fight and we're going to win this fight," Sanders told WPTZ-TV. “Thank goodness we have Bernie Sanders in the Senate trying to restore sanity to the halls of government and protect our right to know what we are feeding to our children and ourselves,” Mark Borax wrote in a letter to the editor of the Brattleboro Reformer.

Top-10 Tax Breaks:  The biggest tax breaks will put $12 trillion into the bank accounts of mostly wealthy Americans over the next decade instead of going into federal coffers to help balance the budget, according to a new study by the Congressional Budget Office.  The study found that 17 percent of the total tax breaks would go to the top 1 percent of income earners, families earning roughly $450,000 or more. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, said the report puts the choice in stark relief: do we keep tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans or cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, college loans, food for seniors and other programs? Unfortunately, Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz, “our Republican friends are adamant about protecting the wealthy and powerful.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9B3694A0-8F55-4510-B4D1-03F41281F996
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Economic Recovery: With home prices and consumer confidence both on the rise, the U.S. economy is in “much better” shape today compared to 2008, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday. He remains concerned, however, about high unemployment, especially among young people and minorities, and gaping inequality in income and wealth in America. “The gap between the very, very rich and everybody else is as wide as it has been since the 1920's,” Sanders said on MSNBC.   Food Labels: “I’m not giving up,” Sanders told Alan Colmes in a Fox News Radio interview on his push to let states require labels for foods that contain genetically modified ingredients. “The American people have a right to know what’s in the food they’re eating.” Sanders’ amendment lost in the Senate last week but he said the fight is far from over, according to a Brattleboro Reformer editorial. The amendment was beaten by Democrats and Republicans, Huffington Post’s Ryan Grimm said on Current TV. Blogging for The Huffington Post, Elizabeth Kucinich questioned the amendment’s opponents’ commitment to states' rights.  Immigration: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid remains confident that Democrats will secure the necessary votes to avoid a filibuster on a comprehensive immigration reform package. National Review Online noted that Sen. Sanders generally supports the measure but has voiced concern that “under the guise of immigration reform” the proposal includes “a process pushed by large corporations which results in more unemployment and lower wages for American workers."   Gas Prices: Sen. Sanders has proposed an amendment to make U.S. federal regulators follow the lead of Europeans and investigate oil- and fuel price manipulation. The Burlington Free Press in a business brief on Thursday reported that Sanders also proposed a 30-day deadline for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to use its emergency powers to curb excessive speculation in crude oil markets.

Yes and No:  The front pages of newspapers on Wednesday were plastered with good-news stories about the economy. “Consumer confidence jumps,” The Washington Post trumpeted. “Americans are in a buying mood,” according to The New York Times. “Home Sales Power Optimism,” was the banner headline in The Wall Street Journal. Is the U.S. economy out of the woods, NBC’s Chris Jansing asked Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday. “That is a great question,” Sanders said, “and the answer is a definitive yes and no.”  “Compared to 2008, no question we're doing much better. Unemployment is down. We have cut the budget deficit in about half. State budgets are doing much better. California was a disaster, now they’re running a surplus. That's the good news.  “But let me give you the not-so-good news. That is, while official unemployment today is at about 7.5 percent, real unemployment, counting those people who have given up looking for work or people working part-time when they want to work full-time, is almost 14 percent. And if you look at young people unemployment or minority unemployment, the numbers are way, way higher than that. More significantly, if you look at the trends impacting the middle class from way, way back, median middle income has gone down $5,000 and most jobs today are not good-paying jobs. They're low-paying jobs.  “And perhaps most frightening is we're seeing more income and wealth inequality in America. So between 2009 and 2011 all of the income in America went to the top 1 percent and in terms of wealth, the gap between the very, very rich and everybody else is as wide as it has been since the 1920s.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=11A3E6AD-3815-4400-B2A1-21D5F0865F3C

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  March against Monsanto: Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he remains unbowed in his fight to give states the right to require that manufacturers of GMO foods label their products. “I have not the slightest doubt that the momentum is with us,” Sanders said in an interview Tuesday with CNN’s Jake Tapper a week after the U.S. Senate defeated his proposed amendment to the farm bill on food labels. Two million people in more than 50 countries marched over the weekend to protest Monsanto, the giant $58 billion multinational corporation that produces pesticides and genetically modified seeds designed to resist lethal chemicals, according to CNN.   Food Labels: With politicians in New York, Connecticut and Vermont pursuing bills to mandate GMO labeling, Sen. Sanders said it made sense to pass a federal law so that individual states wouldn’t be hit with lawsuits from GMO food giants like Monsanto and DuPont, the New York Daily News reported.  “There are about 27 states in this country that are moving forward on the labeling of GMO food … So all that my legislation said is that if … states want to go forward, Monsanto and these other large corporations cannot sue them,” Sanders said. Around the world, dozens of countries already require labels, Sanders said in a blog posted at Nation of Change.   Dental Care: The Northern Tier Centers for Health will expand its dental services in Swanton, Vt., according to the St. Albans Messenger. The clinic that opened in 2010 treats patients on a sliding fee scale so those without insurance can still find care. “We have a major dental care crisis,” said Sen. Sanders who has proposed legislation to expand access to dental care. “Whenever a clinic pops up… they get booked up pretty quickly.”   Jobs for Veterans: Sen. Sanders, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, has introduced a two-part bill to create pilot programs aimed at helping veterans find jobs, Marine Corps Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Memorial Day: Vergennes on Monday hosted the largest and longest Memorial Day parade in Vermont to pay tribute to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. The Burlington Free Press called Sen. Bernie Sanders, a fixture at the holiday commemorative for more than 20 years, noted the first-class effort. “I thank the city of Vergennes and the American Legion for once again putting on the most beautiful parade in the state of Vermont,” he said. Gov. Peter Shumlin and Sanders were among the special guests, WCAX-TV reported.   Sanders is Passionate Supporter of Veterans: “Sanders might seem an unlikely advocate for our veterans … But since he was named chair of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs six months ago, Sanders has proved to be a passionate and outspoken supporter of veterans. A rare inside-the-Beltway political gadfly who has no patience for Washington's chronic conformity, Sanders is not afraid to shake things up on The Hill and get in anyone's face who would deny our war heroes,” Jamie Reno of The Daily Beast blogged.   USPS: Postal Service finances began to sink in 2007 after Congress passed a law that required pre-funding health benefits of future retirees 50 years in advance at a rate of about $5.6 billion a year. Sen. Sanders and Rep. Peter A. Defazio are sponsoring bills to eliminate the pre-funding requirement and allow the Postal Service to raise rates more freely, among other changes. Unions support the bill, and it has some supporters in the Senate and the House, the Los Angeles Times reported.   Older Americans: Sen. Sanders, chairman of Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, is renewing his effort to reauthorize the law that governs social services for seniors, but Republicans still need some convincing. “Investing in the Older Americans Act not only eases human suffering, it saves money. It keeps seniors from going to the hospital, going to nursing homes, allowing them to stay in their own homes,” Sanders said. “I’m not sure that that’s at a level of priority right now that it’s going to get much attention,” Sen. Richard Burr told Congressional Quarterly.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=28D56216-5D5E-4137-844E-50B1BB12C5DB
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Memorial Day: Sen. Bernie Sanders said Memorial Day is “a time to remember and cherish the lives of service members who have died in defense of this nation,” WPTZ-TV reported. “We owe the veterans community more than we can ever pay back,” the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs wrote in the Brattleboro Reformer. Sanders said an “unacceptably long” backlog in processing VA benefits should be helped as the VA switches from a paper to a digital system, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported.   Denmark: Danish Ambassador Peter Taksoe-Jensen spent a weekend in Vermont this month traveling with me to town meetings in Burlington, Brattleboro and Montpelier. Large crowds came out to learn about a social system very different from our own which provides extraordinary security and opportunity for the people of Denmark, Sen. Sanders wrote in a column posted Sunday by The Huffington Post.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=f0d5d753-3b34-4bce-b7fc-7ba85ab34e91
Memorial Day:   Memorial Day must not simply be a day for picnics and ballgames.  It is a time to remember and cherish the lives of service members who have died in defense of this nation and appreciate the unimaginable loss their families have experienced.  But Memorial Day is not just a time to reflect upon the past.  It’s important that we also focus on the present and dedicate ourselves to do all that we can to protect the interests of today’s veterans – many of whom came home from war wounded in body and in spirit.   In recent years we have come a long way in protecting the needs of our veterans, but much more must be done.   Today, more than 6.5 million veterans utilize the  Department of Veterans Affairs health care system.  While VA’s network is regarded as one of the best in the country with cutting-edge achievements, we can and must improve it.  We also must simplify the bureaucracy so that every eligible veteran knows how to access the system.

What can we learn from Denmark? - By Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), The Huffington Post:   Danish Ambassador Peter Taksoe-Jensen spent a weekend in Vermont this month traveling with me to town meetings in Burlington, Brattleboro and Montpelier. Large crowds came out to learn about a social system very different from our own which provides extraordinary security and opportunity for the people of Denmark.  Today in the United States there is a massive amount of economic anxiety. Unemployment is much too high, wages and income are too low, millions of Americans are struggling to find affordable health care and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider.  While young working families search desperately for affordable child care, older Americans worry about how they can retire with dignity. Many of our people are physically exhausted as they work the longest hours of any industrialized country and have far less paid vacation time than other major countries  Denmark is a small, homogenous nation of about 5.5 million people. The United States is a melting pot of more than 315 million people. No question about it, Denmark and the United States are very different countries. Nonetheless, are there lessons that we can learn from Denmark?  Continue reading here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/what-can-we-learn-from-de_b_3339736.html
Today's new from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Memorial Day: Sen. Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont and chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, will be on C-Span’s “Newsmakers Sunday at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.,” talking about issues including the backlog of benefits claims for veterans, according to The New York Times.  Vermont Veterans: A town meeting next Saturday with Sen. Sanders and Deborah Amdur, director of White River Junction VA Medical Center, will focus on how to best address the needs of Vermont veterans. Breakfast starts at 9:30 a.m., followed by a discussion from 10-11:30 a.m. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, will hold similar meetings later in the day in Brattleboro and Bennington, the Valley News reported.  Immigration Reform: “I’m a strong supporter of immigration reform and of the need to provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants … I very strongly believe, as someone who knows what’s going on in the dairy industry in Vermont, that there’s no question we need to create a status for immigrant workers in agriculture … What I do not support is, under the guise of immigrant reform, a process pushed by large corporations which results in more unemployment and lower wages for American workers,” Sen. Sanders told The Washington Post in an interview posted online.  Border Crossings: The immigration bill that emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee this week addressed concerns from Canadian border states. Sanders told The Washington Post, "Where I am now — I’m an hour away from the Canadian border. At Burlington Airport, 25 to 50 percent of the cars are from Quebec. We have a very strong relationship with Canada. Many people in Vermont come from a French Canadian background, there’s lot of commerce between them and the state, and we don’t want to see impediments to that. We want strong security, we understand that, but we do not want impediments to commerce. We’ve made progress on that."

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Immigration Reform: Sen. Sanders supports a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants already in the United States and backs a proposal to let their children go to college or join the military. He is concerned, however, about “an all-out effort” by some American employers “to bring in cheap labor” to replace U.S. workers. “A whole lot of kids in this country need jobs,” he said, but employers would rather pay less to hire foreigners as lifeguards or ski instructors, Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. He also said high-tech companies should offer better pay to attract American engineers instead of taking advantage of skilled foreigners who will work for less. Guest Workers Sen. Sanders and others in the Democratic Caucus remain concerned about the controversial guest-worker provisions in the immigration bill that cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. One way an immigration reform bill could fail would be defections from the left over those provisions that critics say would undermine low-income Americans’ employment opportunities. Sens. Boxer, Brown, Harkin, and Sanders opposed an earlier bill for that reason, but “they’re all likely ‘yes’ votes this time around, with Brown, Harkin and Boxer signaling support already,” according to an online Washington Post analysis.   VA Claims Backlog: The chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs expressed skepticism about proposals to create a presidential commission to examine an enormous backlog of veterans’ disability claims. Sen. Sanders said a presidential panel, which has been pushed by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, would be unlikely to solve the problem. “You bring these people together for 18 more hearings, and in the real world, that slows down the progress you’re making,” Sanders said on C-SPAN’s Newsmakers and The Washington Post online.   Sanders Supports Shinseki: Sen. Sanders stood behind the embattled VA Secretary Eric Shinseki,, reported Politico. “We have serious people undertaking a very difficult job, and you can take pot shots at them all of the time. Will they succeed? I don't know. But my job is to do everything that I can to make sure that they do succeed,” said Sanders.

The Week in Review:   More and more Americans are feeling the pinch from across-the-board spending cuts that Washington budget wonks call sequestration. Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against the automatic cuts that a big majority now also opposes. Bio-tech and food industry giants won a victory on Thursday when the Senate rejected a Sanders amendment on labeling genetically-engineered foods. On Wednesday, he offered another amendment to the farm bill to make federal regulators crack down on oil market speculators that drive up gas prices.  An immigration reform bill that emerged Tuesday from a Senate committee got mixed reviews from Sanders. A bill to reauthorize the landmark Older Americans Act was introduced on Thursday at a seniors’ summit that he organized. And in a Memorial Day weekend edition of C-SPAN’s Newsmakers program, Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders talked about making certain veterans get the benefits they deserve.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Senate Votes No on Food Labeling: The Senate on Thursday rejected an amendment from Sen. Bernie Sanders that would have allowed states to require labeling of genetically modified foods. “People are concerned about the quality of the food they are ingesting and giving their kids,” Sanders said. Sanders promised to continue pushing for states’ rights to GMO labeling, reported The Associated Press.  Sanders Not Giving Up: Vermont could become the first state to mandate GMO labeling and become a test case for anyone in the bio-technology or food industries who wishes to challenge such a law by claiming that food labeling must be left to federal regulators. “Without federal protection for the states, such legal challenges are pretty much guaranteed from an industry with very deep pockets … Fortunately, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders … is not giving up,” the Brattleboro Reformer said in an editorial.   VA Claims Backlog: With Memorial Day a few days away, Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders talked about key issues facing veterans during an interview to be broadcast Sunday on C-Span. He credited VA Secretary Eric’s Shinseki for setting “a very ambitious goal” to eliminate a “completely unacceptable” disability claims backlog. Sanders has introduced legislation that would require quarterly progress reports. Sanders praised President Barack Obama’s commitment to veterans but agreed with House counterparts who this week urged the White House to become more involved in resolving the claims backlog.   Older Americans Act: Updates introduced this week to the Older Americans Act would improve the funding potential for senior care services across the nation. Amendments to the existing legislation, reintroduced by Sen. Sanders, would help support initiatives allowing older Americans to age in their homes and their communities, Senior Housing News reported.

What's in the Food You Eat?  The Senate on Thursday rejected an amendment that would have allowed states to require labeling of genetically modified foods. Sen. Bernie Sanders said afterward that he would continue to push for Congress to make it clear that states may require the labels. The Vermont House passed a labeling bill in May, putting the state at the forefront of the effort. Similar legislation is pending this year in 26 other statehouses around the country.  “The people of Vermont and the people of America have a right to know what's in the food that they eat,” Sanders said.

Older Americans Act:  Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, today introduced legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Older Americans Act which supports Meals on Wheels and other critical programs for seniors. “With 10,000 Americans turning 65 every day, our country’s growing population of seniors includes many who rely on these critical programs to help them stay in their own homes and communities,” said Sanders. Speaking at an Older Americans Summit, Sanders and others unveiled the new bill to extend the landmark law that was first enacted in 1965.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate to Vote on Food Labels: Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to ensure that states may require labeling on foods containing genetically-engineered organisms without fear of litigation from opponents, the Brattleboro Reformer, Bennington Banner and Raw Story reported. Sanders proposed a farm-bill amendment that the Senate is set to vote on today, Congressional Quarterly reported.   Fed Conflicts: Sen. Sanders said Wednesday he would reintroduce legislation to prohibit bankers from serving on the boards of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, The Wall Street Journal reported online. Questioning Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke at a Joint Economic Committee hearing, Sanders noted, “We have had absurd situations where Jamie Dimon, the CEO of the largest financial institution in America, sat on the New York Fed… many of us think that is the fox guarding the hen house.”   LA Votes to Overturn Citizens United: The nation’s second-largest city voted Tuesday for a resolution instructing local and state officials to promote the overturning of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, reported The Huffington Post. Sen. Sanders and Rep. Ted Deutch offered a constitutional amendment in March to overturn the decision, noting the ramifications of unlimited special-interest contributions to political campaigns.   Oklahoma Tornado and Global Warming: Sen. Barbara Boxer took to the Senate floor on Tuesday and invoked the Oklahoma tornadoes in a speech on global warming. “This is climate change,” she said. “This is climate change. We were warned about extreme weather. Not just hot weather, but extreme weather.” She also plugged her bill cosponsored with Sen. Sanders that would put a tax on carbon. “Carbon could cost us the planet,” she said, according to Hardhatters.

End Conflicts of Interest at the Fed:   Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today introduced legislation that would ban bankers from sitting on the boards of directors for 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that regulate the financial industry. Co-sponsored by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Mark Begich (D-Alaska), the bill also would end the practice of letting bankers have a say in the selection of the Fed directors that regulate them.  A companion measure was introduced in the House by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.).  Sanders said, “I think the American people would be shocked to learn that the CEOs of some of the largest banks in America are allowed to serve on the boards of the main agency in this country in charge of regulating these financial institutions – the Federal Reserve. Allowing banking industry executives to serve on the Fed’s boards and hand-pick its members and staff is a clear conflict of interest that must be eliminated.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=34abe048-c705-4ff7-8c15-c3778a6bcd2f

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Gas Prices: With gasoline prices rising rapidly, Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to see federal regulators follow the lead of Europeans and investigate oil and fuel price manipulation. He also proposed a 30-day deadline for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to curb excessive speculation in crude oil markets that can significantly increase oil and gas prices. Sanders said gasoline price hikes are coming at a time when U.S. inventories are at a three-decade high while demand is low, ABC 22 and Fox 44 reported.   Apple Skirts Taxes: Apple avoided paying billions of dollars in U.S. income taxes. A Senate investigation found the tech giant shelters in overseas accounts about $102 billion of its $145 billion in cash, according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. “It is a total scam,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on Tuesday. “It’s not just Apple. Virtually every major multi-national corporation has used these offshore tax havens,” Sanders added. He has introduced legislation that would take away the tax breaks and yield $600 billion in revenue over a decade.   VA Claims Backlog: “While the VA is processing more claims than ever before, it is absolutely unacceptable that veterans, in some cases, are waiting years for their claims to be processed. For whatever reason, the VA did not until 2009, begin doing what the entire corporate sector had done — move from paper to the digital world. Upon assuming his position at the VA, Secretary Eric Shinseki announced a very ambitious transformation of the system. His goal is that by the end of 2015, all claims will be processed within 125 days and with 98 percent accuracy. I intend to work with the secretary to make sure that goal is achieved,” Sanders said in a column for The Hill.  VA Hedges on Disability Backlog: The Department of Veterans Affairs has systematically missed nearly all of its internal benchmarks for reducing a hulking backlog of benefits claims and has quietly backed away from repeated promises to give all veterans and family members speedier decisions by 2015. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders asked VA Secretary Eric Shinseki at a hearing last month whether there were any benchmarks to show progress toward the VA's goals. Shinseki did not answer, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=B8EA9B91-31FF-40E4-AAA6-BB68751F0AAD
Gas Probe Price:   Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Tuesday for an investigation into oil price manipulation.  He also proposed a 30-day deadline for federal regulators to use emergency powers to curb excessive speculation in crude oil markets.  Over the past five months, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline has gone up by more than 41 cents. The price hikes come at a time when U.S. oil inventories reached a three-decade high while demand for gasoline is lower than four years ago when prices averaged less than $2.30 a gallon.  Sanders spoke about rapidly rising gas prices during a Senate floor speech on two amendments he proposed to the farm bill.  Watch the video here: http://youtu.be/lRkKfGr_TWw
Think Different:  Apple avoided paying billions of dollars in U.S. income taxes. A Senate investigation found the tech giant parked overseas about $102 billion of its $145 billion in cash. A subsidiary in Ireland that earned $22 billion in 2011 paid only $10 million in taxes, according to the report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. “It is a total scam,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Ed Schultz on Tuesday. “It’s not just Apple. Virtually every major multi-national corporation has used these offshore tax havens,” Sanders added. He has introduced legislation that would take away the  tax breaks and yield $600 billion in revenue over a decade.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  IRS and Citizens United: Washington continues to focus on the scandal at the Internal Revenue Service while ignoring the root problem. “Nobody wants the IRS singling out applicants based on politics. The American people do, however, want someone … somewhere to do something about the perversion of election finance,” United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard wrote for The Huffington Post. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ted Deutch would reverse the Citizens United decision that some organizations seeking tax exemptions want to exploit, Gerard added.   Denmark: More than 200 people at a town meeting sponsored by Sen. Sanders in Burlington, Vt., heard Denmark's U.S. ambassador, Peter Taksoe-Jensen, lay out a lengthy list of benefits his country provides all its citizens, Seven Days blogged. “Congratulations to Sen. Sanders for setting his sights on the Nordic social model as the direction in which Vermont should move,” Ralph Meima wrote in a letter to the editor of the Brattleboro Reformer.   Greed on Wall Street: A year rarely goes by without another WorldCom, Enron, or Tyco scandalizing the corporate world. Wall Street has become the very definition of greed. As Sen. Sanders said, the "greed culture" in America is out of control. It's exemplified by unfathomable executive salaries and bonuses while employee pay remains unchanged, the Wisconsin State Journal said in an editorial.  Calamitous Climate Change: Last year was the warmest year on record and climate scientists and activists are urging people to pay attention before it’s too late, Elayne Clift blogged for OpEdNews. She cited Sen. Sanders’ warning that scientists actually had underestimated the threat. “What they're now saying is if we don't get our act together and start cutting in a very significant way greenhouse gas emissions, we're talking about this planet heating up by eight degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. That is calamitous.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=E4FDE468-B18A-4ED0-BF4E-5072206BB40C
The Billionaire Bugle:  Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch reportedly are interested in buying the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times and other newspapers. That prospect has some journalists, Sen. Bernie Sanders and many others worried about slanted news coverage. Two recent articles offer perspective on how billionaires try to shape what Americans read and hear and see and think. In a New Yorker article entitled “A Word from our Sponsor,” Jane Mayer wrote about how David Koch was a huge donor and board member of WNET-TV, a New York PBS station largely bankrolled by wealthy donors. Despite the station’s attempts to mollify Koch about a documentary in which he was used as an example of the gap between rich and poor in America, Koch quit the board and decided not to make another huge donation. Then there’s hedge fund billionaire Peter G. Peterson. In “60 Minutes and the Billionaire Agenda,” Richard Eskow wrote about how Peterson has used his vast fortune to promote news coverage about the need to cut Social Security and Medicare, two of his hobbyhorses, and otherwise limit the role of government. Turns out, Eskow reported for Nation of Change, that CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl sat on a board of advisers to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. Journalist Jonathan Tasini reported that CBS wouldn’t talk about it but Stahl is no longer listed on Peterson’s board.

What can we learn from Denmark? - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): http://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20130516/OPINION04/705169957
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Denmark: Sen. Bernard Sanders introduced Danish Ambassador Peter Taksoe-Jensen at a town meeting before a packed audience at Montpelier High School on Sunday, the Times Argus and Rutland Herald reported. At Burlington City Hall on Saturday they discussed Denmark’s approach to health care, education and environmental protection, WCAX-TV and WPTZ-TV reported on Monday. There was not an empty seat in the house at the Brattleboro Museum on Saturday evening, the Brattleboro Reformer reported.  Workers’ Rights: The National Labor Relations Board was set up to protect American workers but Republicans keep blocking the president’ appointments. “The minority is doing everything they can … to make it impossible for working people … to have their rights protected,” Sen. Sanders said in a clip from a hearing last week played Sunday on The Ed Show on MSNBC. “As Sen. Sanders said, Democrats have to step up and change the rules” so nominees may be confirmed by a majority vote, Communications Workers of America President Larry Cohen said.  Social Security: Eight years ago, President Bush tried to privatize Social Security. He got hammered in the midterms. Democrats used Bush`s radical idea to win back the House and add six new faces in the Senate. If President Obama gets his way on Social Security cuts, he could face the same fate in 2014, Ed Schultz warned. “The president continues for some very strange reason to believe that if he makes major concessions to the Republicans that somehow he`s going to get something back in return,” Sen. Sanders said in an excerpt from a Schultz interview.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=FFF917D1-A10B-4DA1-863C-90CC82761955
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  What Can We Learn from Denmark?: Sen. Bernard Sanders is holding public meetings around Vermont this weekend with Denmark’s ambassador to the United States. Sanders said the town hall meetings are aimed at finding out what the United States might learn from Denmark about health care, education and environmental protection. Two of the meetings were held Saturday at Contois Auditorium in Burlington and at the Brattleboro Museum. The third will be held today at Montpelier High School, the Times Argus, Rutland Herald and The Associate Press reported on Sunday.   Obama’s Broken Promise: President Obama is betraying his own promises and his Democratic base by agreeing to cut Social Security. Sen. Sanders asked the president to keep his "campaign promises to strengthen Social Security," Clarence Lusane wrote in The Times of Trenton, N.J., and the Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News. Members of the fiercely loyal Congressional Black Caucus have not hesitated to make their hostility to the proposal known. Leaders of the AFL-CIO, National Organization for Women, MoveOn.org, the Campaign for America's Future and other liberal groups protested in front of the White House. “If Obama has any hope of achieving a fraction of his second-term agenda, he will need to mobilize that base to fight the Republican hard-liners in Congress,” Lusane concluded.   VA Backlog: Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki faces “louder and perhaps more partisan” criticism for his overwhelmed agency's huge and probably still growing inventory of claims for disability compensation filed by wounded or ill veterans. Sen. Sanders the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, praises Shinseki for doing something rare in Washington: setting a deadline, in this case to end the backlog by 2015, mainly by replacing paper claims with a digital process. ''How many secretaries or presidents say, 'I'm going to do something by a certain date?' '' Sanders asked in an interview with The New York Times. Shinseki declined to be interviewed for the article.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=e0d040a6-fb2d-4ac5-81ed-d676e65f728e
60 Minutes and the Billionaire Agenda:   CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl is on the board of directors of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which has outspent all others in an attempt to lower taxes for the wealthy and corporations, while also pushing an anti-government agenda that emphasizes cuts to Medicare and Social Security along with downsizing of most other government functions, Richard (RJ) Eskow wrote for Nation of Change. The foundation is financed by conservative anti-government billionaire Pete Peterson, whose views dominate the Republican Party and are the primary influence for the Democrats’ Clinton/Obama wing.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Student Loans: With student loan rates set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent, Sen. Sanders endorsed “excellent” legislation by Sen. Elizabeth Warren to set student interest rates at the same low 0.75 percent level that the Federal Reserve charges big banks. “The only thing wrong with this bill is that Elizabeth thought of it and I didn’t,” Sanders joked on The Thom Hartmann Program.  FCC Nominee: President Obama’s nominee to head up the Federal Communications Commission will sell hundreds of thousands in AT&T and Verizon shares in order to avoid future conflicts of interest. Sen. Sanders and others previously expressed concern about Tom Wheeler’s close ties to the industry as a former lobbyist, The Hill reported.   Pope on Poverty: Sen. Sanders applauded Pope Francis for condemning a “cult of money” that the pontiff said was oppressing the poor, WAMC-FM and The Huffington Post reported.

Week in Review: Headlines all week blared the latest developments in an IRS scandal, the seizure of Associated Press phone logs and hearings staged by House Republicans on last year’s deadly U.S. consulate attack in Libya. Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized the IRS as “dead wrong.” He faulted the Justice Department for sweeping up reporters’ phone records.  He dismissed the Benghazi hearings as Republicans trying to turn a tragedy to their political advantage. But where, he asked, were the news stories about the collapsing middle class, chronic unemployment and poverty in America?  Bernie welcomed a Tuesday report that the deficit is shrinking. He called again on Thursday for filibuster reform to stop Republicans from using parliamentary tactics to stiff arm President Obama’s nominees. And he joked on Friday about one small problem he has with an otherwise “excellent” student loan bill by Sen. Elizabeth Warren.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=231346E3-59DD-4FF1-9F38-79AAE75F225D
With student loan rates set to double on July 1 to 6.8 percent, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday endorsed legislation by Sen. Elizabeth Warren to set student loan interest rates at the same 0.75 percent level that the Federal Reserve offers to big banks. “A great idea,” Bernie said of Warren’s bill. “The only thing wrong with this bill is that Elizabeth thought of it and I didn’t,” Bernie said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. A Congressional Budget Office report on Tuesday projected that the student loan program administered by the U.S. Department of Education would yield a record $51 billion profit off student borrowers. http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C959DC0B-7D8C-4AAE-8FBF-DF74791B8A26
What Can We Learn from Denmark?   The Danish people rank among the happiest in the world and “enjoy a quality of life that many Americans would envy” with universal health care, inexpensive prescription drugs, strong family-leave laws and free higher education, Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a column published in Friday’s Barre, Vt., Times Argus. The senator will host town meetings this weekend with Danish Ambassador Peter Taksøe-Jensen in Burlington, Brattleboro and Montpelier to explore what Americans could learn from Denmark’s social model.   http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=22AD4F78-8842-4E24-A548-6E80524C96F7
Today's news from Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Pope on Poverty: Sen. Bernie Sanders applauded Pope Francis for condemning a “cult of money” in the world that the pontiff said was oppressing the poor. In a major speech at the Vatican on Thursday, Francis said the global financial system has worsened poverty while benefiting the wealthy few. Sanders commended the pope. “At a time when the gap between rich and everyone else is growing wider, at a time when Wall Street and large financial institutions are exerting extraordinary power over the American and world economy, I applaud the pope for speaking out on these enormously important issues,” Sanders said in the Burlington Free Press.  The Middle Class: Sen. Sanders wished that the news media would pay more attention to what he called “a new normal” in America where real unemployment is almost 14 percent, median income has fallen by $500 since the financial collapse in 2008 and poverty is near an all-time high. While front-page headlines blare the latest news about an IRS scandal, the Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records and the political ramifications of last year’s deadly attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Libya, “the media may not be all that concerned about little things like the collapse of the American middle class,” Sanders told John Nichols on The Ed Schultz Show.  IRS: Joseph Grant, commissioner for the Internal Revenue Service’s tax-exempt and government entities division, resigned as fallout continued over a scandal involving illegal targeting of conservative groups. “It was inappropriate for the I.R.S. to go after one group of people, in this case conservatives,” Sen. Sanders said Thursday on The Ed Schultz Show. But Sanders said the broader issue is how “campaign financing in America today is a total disaster as a result of the outrageous Supreme Court decision in Citizens United” that resulted in “huge amounts of money … coming into the political process” through organizations seeking tax-exempt status.

The New Normal  The news media in Washington, D.C., was focused on a scandal at the IRS, the Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records and the Obama administration’s editing of talking points about the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders said, “the media may not be all that concerned about little things like the collapse of the American middle class.” He argued that the press should pay attention to what he called  “a new normal” in America where real unemployment was almost 14 percent in April, median income has fallen since the economic collapse in 2008 and poverty is near an all-time high.

What Can We Learn from Denmark?  Sen. Bernie Sanders is holding a series of town meetings in Vermont this weekend with Danish Ambassador Peter Taksoe-Jensen. In Denmark, social policy in areas like health care, child care, education and protecting the unemployed are part of a ‘solidarity system’ that provides strong opportunity and security for all citizens,” Bernie said. “Danes pay high taxes, but in return enjoy a quality of life that many Americans would envy.”  Read Bernie’s column, “What Can We Learn from Denmark?” http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=2cced539-17a5-4f20-a855-c62768b8a27c
Cutting Social Security and Not Taxing Wall Street, The Huffington Post  As we move toward the fifth anniversary of the great financial crisis of 2008, people should be outraged that cutting Social Security is now on the national agenda, while taxing Wall Street is not. After all, if we take at face value the claims made back in 2008 by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner, Wall Street excesses brought the economy to the brink of collapse.  But now the Wall Street behemoths are bigger than ever and President Obama is looking to cut the Social Security benefits of retirees. That will teach the Wall Street boys to be more responsible in the future.  Most people are now familiar with President's Obama's proposal to cut Social Security by reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). While the final formula is somewhat convoluted, the net effect is to reduce benefits by an average of roughly 3.0 percent.  Since Social Security benefits account for more than 70 percent of the income of a typical retiree, this cut is more than a 2.0 percent reduction in income. By comparison, a wealthy couple earning $500,000 a year would see a hit to their after-tax income of just 0.6 percent from the tax increase that President Obama put in place last year...

Now it is time to create jobs and protect working families,” said Sanders.  Filibuster Reform: Senate Democrats are considering using a simple majority vote to confirm President Obama’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, The Hill reported. “One of the reasons for disfunctionality is the majority does not rule,” Sanders said of the Senate gridlock caused by Republican abuses of Senate rules. He is among several senators advocating an up-or-down vote on Cabinet nominees.  Learning from Denmark: The Danish people rank among the happiest in the world and “enjoy a quality of life that many Americans would envy” with universal health care, inexpensive prescription drugs, strong family-leave laws, and free higher education, Sen. Sanders wrote in the Rutland Herald. He will host town meetings this weekend with Danish Ambassador Peter Taksøe-Jensen to explore what Americans could learn from Denmark’s social model.

Sanders told Congressional Quarterly.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=D1F3D98D-58D6-4EE7-97C5-25EA883B11BF
Red Ink  The federal deficit is expected to shrink to $642 billion this year, half of what it was four years ago, the Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, welcomed the news. He cautioned, however, that the budget should not be balanced on the backs of seniors and children. And he called for rebuilding the country’s crumbling infrastructure to create millions of jobs, stimulate the economy and help working families. “We must not place ourselves in a situation in which the operation was a success but the patient died, and the patient that I am talking about, of course, is the disappearing middle class, the backbone of this great country.”  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAsIsPGJQBY
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obamacare: Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized the Obama administration for redirecting funds set aside for community health centers to pay for implementation of the Affordable Care Act. “Taking, as I understand, $150 million designed to expand community health centers and putting them into another area is to me very, very disturbing and a real setback for what we had hoped to accomplish in strengthening primary care in America,” Sanders, a key proponent of the health centers, told National Journal. He has voiced his concern to the White House over what he regards as a violation of the spirit of the law.  Corporate Lobbyists Defend Tax Breaks: Sen. Sanders’ bill to end tax breaks for corporations that shelter income overseas was one target of big-money interests that unleashed thousands of lobbyists on Capitol Hill. More than 2,220 organizations spent an estimated $773 million bringing 6,503 lobbyists to influence thousands of tax bills in 2011 and 2012, Reuters reported.

Young, Unemployed, and Discouraged in America:  After an “incredibly disheartening” job search that lasted several months, one young Vermonter told Sen. Bernie Sanders that he “ended up taking an unpaid internship.” Burdensome student loans remain a stumbling block for many just out of college. A 20-year-old Michigan graduate with a technical degree said, “I fear that if I do not get a job soon that I will have to default on my loans or go back to school just to give myself more time.”  With the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-old workers was 16.2 percent in April, Bernie is working on legislation. He asked unemployed young people to tell him their stories. There have been hundreds of responses.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=D99D9152-2160-4C94-9CF3-AB97CBBC312F

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Nuclear Option: Senate Democrats are considering a majority vote “nuclear option” to stop Republican filibusters that are blocking confirmation of President Obama’s nominees, The Hill reported. After last week’s Republican boycott of a vote on Gina McCarthy for EPA administrator, Sen. Bernie Sanders predicted that the Republican minority would throw up more parliamentary roadblocks in the full Senate. “I think it is time for the Democratic leadership to do what he American people want and that is to have a majority rule in the United States Senate,” Sanders said.  VA Backlog: As part of an effort to resolve a VA claims backlog, Sen. Sanders introduced a bill that calls for a working group within the Department of Veterans Affairs to look at ways to hire veterans and evaluate employees who work on claims, Military Times reported. “It is unconscionable that a veteran or family member had to wait, on average, nearly three years for a decision on an appeal,” Sanders said of the backlog.

Guard Outreach  A Vermont National Guard outreach effort will receive $1.8 million this year for the pioneering program that informs veterans and their families about benefits they have earned, Vermont’s congressional delegation announced today. The award is Vermont’s share of $20 million for eight states that have adopted the Vermont outreach program model and a new effort to expand the program to National Guard and Reserve units nationwide.  The Vermont program was launched in 2006 with funds secured by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who now chairs the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “In a rural state like ours, soldiers coming home can be isolated. What we did was put together a team of veterans to go out and visit people in their homes to talk to them and help them get the services that are available to them. I am proud that the Vermont outreach program has become a model for the nation,” Sanders said.

College Tuition: A new report indicates that hundreds of colleges are charging low-income students higher prices while offering tuition discounts to wealthier classmates, according to The Atlantic. Jordan Weissman argues that the federal government could make tuition free or close to it if it were to take all of the money it pours into various forms of financial aid each year. But that won’t happen, he said, unless Sen. Sanders “leads a Latin American style-coup down Pennsylvania Avenue.”  The Fed: Former Sen. Judd Gregg writes in The Hill that “it is a hardened belief on the extremities of both the left and right that the Federal Reserve is at the center of many of our economic ills.” If Congress would just end the Fed both former Rep. Ron Paul and Sen. Sanders “would be happy,” Gregg wrote, misstating Sanders’ position.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=51BB6E09-C9B2-4530-B4BF-AD78297482E6

Mr. President, Don't Cut Social Security: http://youtu.be/Pmg9hshxbFs
Heat-Trapping Gas Passes Milestone, Raising Fears - Justin Gillis, The New York Times:  The level of the most important heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, has passed a long-feared milestone, scientists reported on Friday, reaching a concentration not seen on the earth for millions of years.  Scientific monitors reported that the gas had reached an average daily level that surpassed 400 parts per million — just an odometer moment in one sense, but also a sobering reminder that decades of efforts to bring human-produced emissions under control are faltering.  The best available evidence suggests the amount of the gas in the air has not been this high for at least three million years, before humans evolved, and scientists believe the rise portends large changes in the climate and the level of the sea.  “It symbolizes that so far we have failed miserably in tackling this problem,” said Pieter P. Tans, who runs the monitoring program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that reported the new reading.

If we do not exercise majority rule, we are more to blame than they are.”   FCC Nominee: Big business is cheering on Tom Wheeler’s nomination for FCC chairmanship. Wheeler’s past as the chief lobbyist for cable and wireless company groups concerns those worried about future media consolidation, including Sen. Sanders, Joel Bleifuss wrote for In These Times “More and more of our media are owned and controlled by fewer and fewer multinational media conglomerates.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  EPA Nominee Blocked: Republican senators on Thursday staged a surprise boycott of a committee meeting and stalled the confirmation of President Obama's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sanders told Free Speech Radio. He called on Congress to pass his legislation to break up the nation’s biggest banks.   Carbon Tax: Sens.

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday brought together seniors and veterans organizations and other members of Congress for a Capitol summit meeting to protest proposed cuts in Social Security and disabled veterans’ benefits. “There are fair ways to reduce deficit but balancing the budget on the backs of the elderly, the sick, the children and the poor are not among them,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Democrats Defect on Obama Budget: The majority of Senate Democrats running in 2014, including three from red states, have broken with President Obama and are opposing his effort to cut Social Security benefits. “The only way you beat right-wing Republicans is contrasting your views with theirs, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday on The Ed Show. “You’ve got to stand up and fight for a middle class which is disappearing.

Doc Crisis: “The American approach to primary health care is one of the more glaring failures of a dysfunctional health care system that costs almost twice as much per capita as that of any other major country — often with worse results. We need to substantially increase the number of primary-care practitioners … to save lives, ease suffering and save billions of dollars in wasteful health care costs,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a Politico op-ed.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=25EAE856-F9EA-422C-AA5F-2D3C48E6F73E
Dental Care for Kids:  Millions of children are suffering today because they do not receive dental care.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Koch Brothers: Sen. Sanders and Jim Dean, chairman of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America, sent a letter to Tribune Co. CEO Peter Liguori asking him to reject any offer from Koch Industries to buy the newspaper chain, the Wichita (Kan.) Business Journal reported. The letter called owners Charles and David Koch “right-wing extremists” with “enormous economic and political power.”   Tax Havens: Thirty-one corporations in the Business Round Table – a group favoring the slashing of Social Security and Medicare benefits – have avoided $128 billion in federal income taxes by setting up more than 500 subsidiaries in tax haven countries while receiving $6.5 billion in IRS tax refunds. Sen. Sanders and Rep. Jan Schokowsky introduced legislation that would require corporations to pay U.S. taxes on offshore profits, according to the Charleston, W. Va., Gazette-Mail.   USPS: One of the Postal Service's biggest problems is a 2006 law that requires it to pre-fund the health benefits of future retirees 50 years in advance at a rate of about $5.6 billion per year. Sen. Sanders and Rep. Peter DeFazio are sponsoring bills to eliminate the pre-funding requirement and allow the Postal Service to raise rates more freely, among other changes, the Orlando Sentinel and the Newport News, Va., Daily Press reported.  FCC: The Federal Communications Comission has “failed” in its mission to enforce net neutrality and promote diversity in media ownership, Mark Lloyd wrote for The American Prospect. When the FCC released a proposal to relax media concentration regulations, Sen. Sanders and more than 40 House and Senate Democrats opposed the changes. The reaction from Congress forced the FCC to delay changing the media cross-ownership rules.

Bank Fraud:  At least eight federal agencies are investigating JPMorgan Chase at a time when the bank is raking in record profits, according to The New York Times. “Virtually every single major financial institution in this country has engaged in fraud at one time or another,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on the Thom Hartmann Program. “So the question that has to be raised is whether fraud is the business model of Wall Street? I think you can probably make a case that it is.” Among many examples, JPMorgan Chase in 2011 paid $156.3 million to settle fraud charges related to the financial crisis.  No one went to jail. In a separate settlement that same year, the bank paid $56 million over allegations that it had overcharged members of the military on their mortgages.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  FCC: President Obama's nominee to head the Federal Communications Commission has an extensive history with the industries he would be in charge of regulating, experience that has some observers wondering if Tom Wheeler was the best choice for the job. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he was “troubled” that the president would nominate a person with such extensive lobbying experience to the powerful post, The Hill reported. “The head of the FCC should be looking out first and foremost for the public interest and may have to stand up to some of our nation's biggest media and telecom companies,” Sanders said.   Health Care: The stress that 30 million additional insured people will place on the health care system in 2014 requires funneling more resources into primary health care training, witnesses told a Senate panel. The current shortfall in primary care physicians of 16,000 is projected to rise by 50,000 by 2025, said Sen. Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions primary health and aging subcommittee, according to an American Medical Association newsletter.   Guard Duty Costs Jobs: Federal law does not allow employers to penalize service members because of their military duties, but thousands of National Guard and Reserve troops coming home from Afghanistan and elsewhere find they have been replaced, demoted, denied benefits or seniority, the Los Angeles Times reported. Government agencies are among the most frequent offenders, accounting for about a third of the more than 15,000 complaints filed since 2001, records show. Others named in the cases include some of the biggest names in American business, such as Wal-Mart and United Parcel Service.   College Costs: Private U.S. colleges, worried they could be pricing themselves out of the market after years of relentless tuition increases, are offering record financial assistance to keep classrooms full, The Wall Street Journal reported. The average "tuition discount rate"—the reduction off list price afforded by grants and scholarships given by these schools—hit an all-time high of 45 percent last fall for incoming freshmen, according to a survey being released Monday by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   USPS: Postal Service finances sank after Congress passed legislation in 2006 that required pre-funding the health benefits of future retirees 50 years in advance at a rate of about $5.6 billion per year, a situation some call a  "manufactured crisis." Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter DeFazio are sponsoring bills to eliminate the pre-funding requirement and allow the Postal Service to raise rates more freely, among other changes. Unions support the bill and it has some supporters in the Senate and the House, the Chicago Tribune reported on Sunday.  FCC: Sen. Sanders had some choice words on the issue of media consolidation and President Obama’s nominee to chair the Federal Communications Commission. "Before the Senate votes on Mr. Wheeler's confirmation, the American people deserve to know where he stands on one of the most important issues facing our nation: the fact that more and more of our media are owned and controlled by fewer and fewer multi-national media conglomerates. Will Mr. Wheeler support that dangerous trend or will he oppose it?" Sanders asked in Adweek.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Unemployment: Sen. Bernie Sanders said real unemployment rose in April to 13.9 percent. That figure from the Labor Department counts workers forced into part-time jobs and those who dropped out of the labor market. “It should be a real concern to all of us,” Sanders told Thom Hartmann on WWRL-AM in New York and other stations. Among “the hardest hit groups” are young people graduating from high school or leaving college with heavy student loan debts. Sanders renewed his call for rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure to create millions of good paying jobs.  Koch Brothers: Sen. Sanders and Jim Dean, chairman of Democracy for America, penned a letter to the CEO of Tribune Company asking it not to sell any of its newspapers to Koch Industries, reported The Hill.

The Week in Review:   The April unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 7.5 percent but the real unemployment rate was almost twice that much, according to a Labor Department report on Friday. Maine on Tuesday became the 13th state to go on record in favor of a constitutional amendment to reverse a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that voided limits on campaign spending by corporations and wealthy individuals. The Vermont House on Friday passed a resolution against President Obama’s proposal to cut Social Security. The president nominated a former telecommunications lobbyist to head the Federal Communications Commission. Before voting on his confirmation, Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Too Big to Fail: Wall Street is aggressively fighting new bills to limit the size of massive banks, according to New York magazine. The efforts to beat back a bill by Sens. Sherrod Brown and David Vitter and an associated break-up-the-banks bill proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Brad Sherman have evolved over time, Kevin Roose wrote for the magazine.   Sanders Questions FCC Pick: Sen. Bernie Sanders expressed concerns about the lobbying past of Tom Wheeler, the president’s nominee to head the Federal Communications Commission, reported The Hill. “The head of the FCC should be looking out first and foremost for the public interest and may have to stand up to some of our nation’s biggest media and telecom companies,” said Sanders.   Unemployment: The unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 7.5 percent in April when employers added 165,000 jobs, the Labor Department announced on Friday. Hiring was much stronger in the previous two months than first thought, The New York Times reported. Real unemployment rose to 13.9 percent. That counts workers forced into part-time jobs and those who dropped out of the workforce because they couldn’t find a job.   VA Claims Backlog: The top official in the Department of Veterans Affairs, Secretary Eric K. Shinseki, came to Connecticut on Thursday to highlight a new electronic system designed to sharply reduce the lengthy lag time in processing disability claims. A new Veterans Benefit Management System is part of the VA's transition to an automated claims process rolled out in the Hartford region about six months ago, the Hartford Courant reported.

Rich are Getting Richer:  “A few people on the top have incredible wealth and incredible power while the people at the bottom have neither,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. “On economic issues, we are losing ground.” He was talking about a new study that showed the wealthy got wealthier after the recession while the vast majority of Americans saw their net worth shrink.  The average wealth of the 8 million households in America with a net worth around $800,000 rose from 2009 to 2011 by nearly 30 percent to $3.2 million, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. While those in the top 7 percent were faring so well, the remaining 93 percent, some 111 million households, saw their net worth drop by 4 percent to $134,000.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Questions FCC Pick: President Obama on Wednesday nominated a veteran cable and wireless industry lobbyist who also was a major fundraiser for his presidential campaigns to chair the Federal Communications Commission. Sen. Bernie Sanders questioned whether Tom Wheeler would support the “dangerous trend” toward greater media consolidation, Congressional Quarterly, Bloomberg Businessweek, Communications Daily, Broadcasting & Cable, The American Spectator and Multichannel News reported.   Citizens United: Maine became the 13th state to urge adoption of a constitutional amendment to reverse a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that struck down limits on campaign spending by corporations and wealthy individuals. The resolution follows an amendment proposal in March by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ted Deutch, according to The Huffington Post.   Arbitration Clauses: Sen. Bernie Sanders signed a letter from Sen. Al Franken to the Securities Exchange Commission demanding an end to the practice of Wall Street brokerage firms forcing investors into arbitration agreements, reported The Hill. Lawmakers are concerned that mandatory arbitration clauses limit investors’ legal rights to protect themselves in court.   Veterans Caregivers: Sen. Sanders introduced legislation to extend to all veterans with a serious service-connected injury eligibility to participate in the family caregiver services program that now covers post 9/11 veterans, Targeted News Service reported. The bill was referred to the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, which Sanders chairs.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=06F0D5F4-C95D-4FBE-9F01-E05E893884DD
Meals on Wheels:   Federal funding for senior nutrition has been lopped off by the across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration. The White House has said the cuts would mean 4 million fewer meals for seniors this year. In Vermont alone, Older Americans Act funds last year provided more than 1 million meals to seniors. Sequestration will cut almost $200,000 for Vermont meals programs by the end of this fiscal year. “There are few better investments than the cost-effective programs that millions of older adults depend on for a healthy and dignified life,” Sen. Bernie Sanders and 23 other senators said in a letter sent on Friday to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate appropriations panel in charge of funding Older Americans Act programs.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Citizens United: Maine became the 13th state to urge adoption of a constitutional amendment to reverse a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that struck down limits on campaign spending by corporations and wealthy individuals. The resolution supports an amendment proposed in March by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ted Deutch, according to The Bangor Daily News, The Raw Story, Politicus USA, and Truthout.   American Oligarchy: Sen. Sanders says we've become an oligarchy. “If anything, that's an understatement,” Thom Hartmann wrote for Truthout. “Thanks to court rulings like Citizens United and the corruptive influence of money in politics, our corporations and corporate executives have become almost untouchable figures in society today, and that needs to change.”   VA Benefits Logjam: VA documents reveal 65,000 widows, widowers, children and parents – triple the number during Obama’s first term – are waiting as long as 207 days – up from two months four years ago – for a burial benefit of $600 to $2,000. Another 50,000 survivors – mostly elderly widows who depended on their husbands’ VA pensions before their deaths – now wait an average of 229 days – twice as long as in 2009 – to find out whether they qualified for a pension. The VA official in charge of benefits told Sen. Sanders, the Senate veterans’ committee chairman, that she “would like to see if some internal VA processes can be adjusted,” the Daily Beast reported.   Global Warming: “Readers should ask their senators and representatives to support a revenue-neutral national carbon tax modeled on the one proposed by Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sanders in their Climate Protection Act of 2013,” Judy Weiss wrote in a letter to the editor of The Sacramento Bee.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Citizens United: A constitutional amendment proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders to undo a Supreme Court ruling on campaign spending drew support Monday at a Maine Citizens for Clean Elections rally in the Statehouse Hall of Flags. State Sen. Richard Woodbury will propose a resolution Tuesday that would put the state behind a drive to overturn the 2010 court decision that struck down limits on campaign spending by corporations and wealthy donors, The Bangor Daily News reported.   VA Backlog: The Department of Veterans Affairs plans to clean up a disability claims backlog by 2015, but veterans and lawmakers remain skeptical, reported The Beaver County (Pa.) Times. “Many of us have serious doubts,” Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders said.  Big Bank Bailouts: Sen. Sanders proposed legislation that would break up big banks and financial institutions that crashed the economy, the New Jersey weekly News Record reported. Meanwhile, big banks are considering a proposal that would force depositors to offset the costs of resuscitating a bank that is “too big to fail,” according to a Huffington Post article that called Sanders’ bill a “critical” first step.   Lincoln: The Academy Award-winning movie Lincoln provided a fresh look at the role Vermont native Thaddeus Stevens played in fighting for the passage of the 13th Amendment to end slavery in the United States. “To help more people learn about the important role Stevens played during a tumultuous period in our nation’s history, I am hosting a free screening of Lincoln next Saturday at St. Johnsbury Academy,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published by the Valley News and Newport Daily Express.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=3352B229-FEEE-4C82-9A66-DB2607ABFC67

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Defense Cuts Shrink Growth: The economy grew only 2.5 percent in the first quarter in large part because of a sharp 11.5 percent drop in military spending. The Washington Post said lawmakers on the left have argued for years that the bloated military budget should be scaled back, but they also advocate government spending to create jobs. “I don't want to see anybody lose their jobs," said Sen. Bernard Sanders, but military spending should not be preserved just because it keeps people employed. The money should be redirected toward better sources of employment, he said, such as investing in construction projects that benefit the economy - building roads and bridges, for example - or education.   Wealth Gap: Millions of Americans suffered a loss of wealth during the recession and the sluggish recovery that followed. But the last half-decade has proved far worse for black and Hispanic families than for white families, according to a new study from the Urban Institute, starkly widening the already large gulf in wealth between white Americans and most minority groups, The New York Times reported.   Rx Fraud: The United States accused unit of the Swiss drug maker Novartis of paying multimillion-dollar kickbacks to doctors in exchange for prescribing its drugs. The authorities said the company lavished healthy speaking fees and “opulent” meals to induce doctors to prescribe its drugs. They said this led to the Medicare and Medicaid programs’ paying millions of dollars in reimbursements based on kickback-tainted claims for medication like the hypertension drugs Lotrel and Valturna and the diabetes drug Starlix, Reuters reported.   House Votes To Require Union Fees For Teachers, Municipal Workers: Under a bill approved 85-to-53 by the Vermont House on Friday, teachers and municipal employees who are not members of a union would still have to pay agency fees. Supporters argue that Vermont’s municipal and educational institutions have been unionized for years, and they say new hires have known they’re accepting a position in a union shop, AP reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   What About Head Start? Teachers?: Congress on Friday passed legislation to bring the nation’s air traffic control system back to full strength. President Obama reversed his stand that airport bottlenecks should be addressed only as part of a broader fix to across-the-board spending cuts and said he will sign the bill. “Clearly, there was a serious problem … but you’ve got 70,000 kids who are going to lose slots in Head Start. I don’t think our Republican friends are going to be quite so quick to respond to that serious crisis,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told radio host Ed Schultz. “When teachers are laid off, I don’t think our Republican friends are going to be there.”  Don’t Cheat Seniors: Some 250 economists say the current formula for calculating Social Security cost-of-living adjustments may underestimate seniors’ purchasing needs. Sens. Sanders and Tom Harkin cited that study when they proposed a resolution to put the Senate on record against President Obama’s proposal to cut Social Security. “What [seniors] are buying are heath care [and] prescription drugs. They’re heating their homes. They are buying food. Those costs have, in general, risen faster than inflation,” Sanders told Ed Schultz.

Week in Review:   In Washington, Senators launched a new move to block President Obama’s proposal to cut benefits for Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and their survivors. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Tom Harkin were leading the charge on Wednesday. A hearing on Tuesday examined solutions to the severe and worsening shortage of primary care doctors in America. As chairman of the Senate veterans committee, Sanders introduced a bill on Thursday to plug gaps in the safety net for homeless veterans.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Veteran Homelessness: A vow by the Obama administration to eliminate veteran homelessness in two years got a shot in the arm Thursday when leaders of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs proposed legislation to help plug holes in the existing veteran safety net, NBC News reported online.   VA Outreach: A Senate hearing on Wednesday examined outreach by the Veterans Affairs Department and community organizations, Military Times reported. “In many areas, VA does enormously good work and enormously important work,” said Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders. “But no matter how good the programs are that the VA has … it doesn’t mean anything to the veteran if the veteran does not know what that program is about.”   Border Fee: Members of Congress from states along the U.S. border with Canada oppose a new fee for Canadians crossing into the United States, Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy have long pushed to make it as easy as possible for people to cross the border by land, The Associated Press reported in an article published by the Burlington Free Press and Brattleboro Reformer. “Clearly we want to make sure our border is secure,” Sanders told The Caledonian-Record, but he said Canadians should not be discouraged from visiting and shopping in the U.S.   Carbon Tax: A Senate Finance Committee white paper about potential federal tax code changes suggested the substitution of a carbon tax for all other energy tax incentives, reported The Hill. Legislation crafted by Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer was listed as a possible model for the tax.

Homeless Veterans:  The chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs today proposed legislation to help the Department of Veterans Affairs meet its goal to eliminate veteran homelessness by 2015. The Homeless Veterans Prevention Act of 2013 is sponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Richard Burr (R-N.C.). While there has been a 17 percent decline in the number of homeless veterans since 2009, there still were more than 62,000 homeless veterans as of the latest count by the VA.  “We must continue to invest in the progress that has been made and remove any remaining barriers to housing for veterans,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Resolution: Don’t Cut Social Security: Sens. Bernie Sanders and Tom Harkin on Wednesday introduced a resolution opposing President Obama’s proposed cuts to Social Security and disabled veterans’ benefits, The Hill reported. Harkin and Sanders suggested an alternative to strengthen Social Security. They would lift the current cap on income subject to the payroll tax.   Sanders’ Solution: Writing about “the left’s sharp criticism” of Obama’s proposal to cut Social Security, The Associated Press said Sen. Sanders is leading a petition drive opposing "any benefit cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid." The deficit, he said, "was primarily caused during the Bush years by two unpaid-for wars, huge tax breaks for the rich and a prescription drug program" for Medicare, funded through borrowing. Higher taxes on the wealthy are the fairest way to tackle the deficit, he said.   Obama and Progressives: House progressives joined with Sen. Sanders in requesting a meeting with President Obama to discuss his proposal to change the consumer price index in a way that would erode benefits for retirees and veterans, according to a Washington Post blog and Talking Points Memo.   Deficit Hawk Hypocrites: “Deficit hawks just got a reality check from Sen. Sanders,” The Huffington Post reported after a speech by the senator on Wednesday expressing opposition to deficit reduction legislation that would cut programs important to the middle class. “You cannot talk about how you proceed with deficit reduction, you cannot say that it is okay to cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid or nutrition programs when the middle class of this country is disappearing,” Sanders said.

Food Labeling:   Legislation that would require the Food and Drug Administration to clearly label genetically engineered foods so that consumers can make informed choices about what they eat was introduced on Wednesday.  Sen. Bernie Sanders cosponsored the bill by Sen. Barbara Boxer.  “All over this country people are becoming more conscious about the foods they are eating and the foods they are serving to their kids. This is certainly true for genetically engineered foods,” Senator Sanders said. “I believe that when a mother goes to the store and buys food for her child she has the right to know what she is feeding her child.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=798EC32A-32BD-4787-868F-29C74F8A67E0
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Primary Care Crisis: Sen. Bernie Sanders says Medicare and other federal health programs should play a bigger role in increasing the supply of primary care physicians. Sanders chaired a primary health subcommittee hearing Tuesday on the state of the primary care work force. Some experts have argued that the United States already has a shortage of primary care doctors, and that problems with access to primary care will get worse when the Affordable Care Act expands the number of people who have health insurance, the health care website LifeHealth Pro reported.   Sanders is Right: Refereeing a dispute over corporate tax rates in the United States, Citizens for Tax Justice concluded that Sen. Sanders “is right and the Tax Foundation is wrong.” The respected tax policy group concluded that “by any measure, U.S. corporate income taxes are very low, and as a share of the economy, they are much lower than are corporate income taxes in almost every other developed country.”    VA Backlog: Thirteen Republican lawmakers signed a letter to President Obama, asking him to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, Politico reported. House Veterans’ Committee Chairman Rep. Jeff Miller said the VA was “one national mission away from complete collapse.” In the Senate, VA Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said Secretary Shinseki is “doing a very good job,” although he could “do a lot better” explaining his efforts to Congress and the public.   Irene Recovery: Sen. Patrick Leahy pressed Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano Tuesday for a resolution to ongoing funding requests from Bennington and other Vermont towns for emergency work completed after Tropical Storm Irene.  Leahy and Sen. Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch wrote to Napolitano in February regarding ongoing funding issues in Vermont related to the August 2011 storm, the Bennington Banner and Brattleboro Reformer reported.

“In the United States today, some 45,000 people unnecessarily die each year because they don't get to a doctor in time,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. “Major reforms in primary care will save lives and save billions in health care costs,” he added in his opening statement at the hearing he chaired of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Earth Day: On Earth Day on Monday, Sen. Bernie Sanders addressed the “planetary crisis of global warming” with a call to action, The Hill reported. Sanders and Sen. Barbara Boxer have introduced a bill to help lower the nation’s carbon output. “To strike at the roots of carbon pollution, Sen. Sanders and I have introduced legislation that puts a price on carbon pollution, protects consumers with a rebate and reinvests funds to promote renewable energy,” Boxer said in a separate statement.   Citizens United: There is so far no interest by either U.S. senator from New York in a constitutional amendment to repeal the 2010 Supreme Court decision that unhinges a century's worth of campaign finance laws. Constitutional amendments proposed by Sens. Sanders and Max Baucus have no cosponsors. Same for proposals by Rep. Marcy Kaptur, The Buffalo News reported.   EPA Faults State Department on Tar Sands Pipeline: The Environmental Protection Agency sharply criticized the State Department’s impact statement for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, saying the report failed to adequately consider the climate change impacts of building the pipeline or to realistically assess alternative pipeline routes or modes of transport. In a relatively unusual public squabble between agencies, a top E.P.A. official said in a letter to State Department officials that the department’s latest environmental statement for the 1,700-mile pipeline provided “insufficient information” to adequately judge the project, and that the E.P.A. could not sign off on the pipeline unless more complete studies were performed, The New York Times reported.   Guns: Gov. Peter Shumlin said advocates for stricter gun measures should keep their focus on Congress, not state Legislatures, Vermont Public Radio reported. Shumlin met with Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy in Washington, D.C., prior to a vote last Thursday. “They were optimistic that we’d have a sensible background check in all 50 states,” the governor asserted.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Earth Day: Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling for bold action to reverse climate change. With scientists now expecting average temperatures to rise 8 degrees by the end of the century, Sanders said the U.S, must take a leadership role or face the scrutiny of future generations. He is a sponsor of legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions, WCAX-TV reported. “If we are serious about protecting the planet and improving our economy, America's energy future must focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV.   Health Care: It is unconscionable that anyone would hold senior citizens and the disabled accountable for a system of runaway costs and below-average quality, Dr. Kevin Kavanagh wrote in an op-ed for The Lexington (Ky.) Herald Leader. He cited a letter from Sen. Sanders to the American Hospital Association criticizing AHA's plans to promote increasing Medicare's eligibility age from 65 to 67, and the beneficiary's cost sharing requirements from 25 percent to 35 percent.   Obama Targets Oldest Seniors: In a move that would hit Social Security’s beneficiaries when they are at their most vulnerable, President Obama has proposed slowing the rate at which benefits increase over time, a change that would ultimately hit the oldest of the old, often single women, many of whom have probably exhausted any other savings. Advocates for retirees say that what is perhaps the most frustrating about all of this is that Social Security, which is self-financed through payroll taxes, does not contribute to the deficit, according to The New York Times.   Senate to Vote on Internet Sales Tax: The days of tax-free online shopping could finally be numbered. The Senate is planning to vote on a bill as soon as Monday that would give states the authority to collect sales taxes on all Internet purchases, handing local governments as much as $11 billion per year in added revenue that they are legally owed — but that hasn’t been paid to them for years, The Washington Post reported. Since before the dawn of Internet shopping, the basic rule was that as long as a retailer didn’t have a physical presence in the state where the consumer was shopping, the company wouldn’t have to collect a sales tax.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  VA Claims Backlog: Veterans have to wait more than nine months before they begin receiving monthly checks to offset the lost salary and costs from the injuries they’ve sustained.  The backlogged claims — those that have been around for at least 125 days — totaled 588,724 as of Thursday, accounting for 69 percent of all the pending claims nationwide. “More and more veterans, younger veterans, are coming into the VA system,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, said in a recent interview with the Valley News.    Chairman Sanders: The tousled-haired 71-year-old Vermont independent who took over the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs in January has embraced the role with a populist gusto that has won him staunch backing from veterans groups, according to a Washington Post report published by the Seattle Times.  “He’s very passionate about the issues,” said Bob Wallace, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. “I think he’s going to be very good for veterans.”   Thank You Sen. Sanders: Sen. Sanders “knows that veterans and seniors earned their benefits through hard work and sacrifice. So when politicians in Washington proposed cutting Social Security and veterans’ benefits Sen. Sanders stood up for us,” according to a full-page ad by AARP in the Burlington Free Press.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Boston Marathon Bombing Suspect Caught: Police descended Friday on a shrouded boat in a Watertown backyard to capture the suspected terrorist who had eluded their enormous dragnet for a tumultuous day, ending a dark week in Boston that ­began with the bombing of the world’s most prestigious road race, The Boston Globe reported.   Seniors Meeting: Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke during a special "Town Meeting on Senior Issues" at the St. Johnsbury House on Friday, according to The Caledonian-Record. “Many were concerned about the possibility of cuts to Social Security, News 7 at Lyndon State reported. “It could mean the difference between whether one purchases the prescription drugs one needs, heats the house adequately to keep warm,” Sanders said.   Background Checks: Despite the support of a “significant majority” of 56 senators, a proposal to improve background checks on gun purchases was blocked by a Republican filibuster. “In the United States Senate the majority does not rule. You need 60 votes,” Sen. Sanders said Friday on WWRL-AM in New York and other stations that broadcast The Thom Hartmann Program. Sanders called the defeated measure “a very common sense approach to … try to make sure that we keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them.  Thank You Sen. Sanders: Sen. Sanders “knows that veterans and seniors earned their benefits through hard work and sacrifice. So when politicians in Washington proposed cutting Social Security and veterans’ benefits Sen.

The Week in Review:  Security was stepped up in cities across the country after Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings that police blamed on terrorists. Sen. Bernie Sanders called it “a tragedy beyond words.” In Washington, security was heightened around the White House and on Capitol Hill even as an unrelated case developed. Letters that contained poison were intercepted on their way to President Obama, a senator and a judge. Meanwhile, the Senate rejected proposals to deal with gun violence. A Republican filibuster blocked consideration of the measures inspired by last December’s shootings that killed 20 first-grade students and six teachers in Newtown, Conn. And a White House proposal to cut benefits for Social Security recipients and disabled veterans was scrutinized at a Senate Budget Committee hearing on Tuesday. Sanders discussed the week’s events during his weekly radio and Internet program on Friday. Listen to The Thom Hartmann Program  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=5A8545B9-730A-4346-A077-CA34838E8E64

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  One Boston Bombing Suspect Dead: One of two suspects wanted in Monday’s deadly Boston marathon bombing was killed early Friday in a violent standoff with the police in a quiet residential neighborhood just west of Boston. The second suspect remained at large following what authorities described as a deadly crime spree that left one police officer dead and another seriously wounded, The New York Times reported.   Falling Gas Prices: According to gasbuddy.com, in the past month the average price of a gallon of gas in Burlington has gone from $3.74 down now $3.53. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been leading the effort to force greater competition in the Vermont gasoline market, Fox44, ABC22 reported.   Town Meeting: Sen. Sanders will hold a town meeting today in St. Johnsbury to talk about senior issues. Sanders will be joined by the heads of the Northeast Vermont Area Agency on Aging and Community of Vermont Elders. The meeting will be held at 11:30 a.m. at the St. Johnsbury House, the Associated Press reported.   The ‘Hoax’: Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma believes that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by Al Gore, the United Nations, and the Hollywood elite. He didn't dispute that at a Senate hearing this week. In fact, when Sanders asked him about it, Inhofe’s conspiracy theory thickened. "I would add to that list MoveOn.org, George Soros, Michael Moore, and a few others," Inhofe said. MoveOn.org blogged.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=308AAB9B-CC46-41C2-BFE5-192E20F0393E
Sanders Push Helps Bring Down Gas Prices:  Gasoline prices in Vermont are coming down. Northwestern Vermont for years has been one of the most profitable places in the country to sell gas. But stations in Chittenden, Franklin and Grand Isle counties lately have had some of the lowest-priced gas in the state. The Burlington Free Press credits Sen. Bernie Sanders for having “kept up a steady campaign of questioning the reasoning behind the difference in price, including holding a congressional field hearing in Burlington last year.”  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=D842DB4B-FE7B-4B0C-A1A8-06B03B675C4A
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Rejects Gun Limits: A push to restrict firearms, touched off by December's mass shooting of schoolchildren, collapsed in the Senate on Wednesday. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy were among the 54 senators who voted to expand background checks on gun purchasers, but the measure needed 60 votes to pass, WPTZ-TV and WCAX-TV reported. “Nobody believes that gun control by itself is going to end the horrors we have seen in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., Tucson, Ariz., and other American communities,” Sanders said in Seven Days. “There is a growing consensus, however, in Vermont and across America that we have got to do as much as we can to end the cold-blooded, mass murders of innocent people.”   Immigration Reform: Dairy farmers would be able to hire immigrant workers on year-round visas for up to three years under a sweeping immigration proposal released Wednesday by a bipartisan group of senators. Sen. Sanders said the proposal would strengthen workers’ rights and give farmers access to a legal workforce.   Gas Prices: Fall Gas prices continue to dip in Vermont with Crittenden County leading the way for the cheapest gas, the Burlington Free Press reported. Sen. Sanders has questioned why gas prices in northwestern Vermont have been significantly greater than in the rest of the state. “This tells me what I have long suspected: That there is no real economic reason why gas prices in northwest Vermont should be 10, 15 or 20 cents per gallon higher than the rest of the state.”   Obama Budget: President Obama’s budget continues to receive criticism from both sides of the aisle, according to an editorial in The Philadelphia Inquirer republished by the The Bellingham (Wash.) Herald. Republicans don’t want any tax increases while the proposal angering liberals most would change the way the government calculates annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. “If you want to defend the middle class, you don’t cut Social Security,” protested Sen. Sanders.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=AF94D9FE-44BD-45A4-AD6E-287EE0B9F342
Senate Rejects Assault Weapons Ban, Background Checks:  Sen. Bernie Sanders voted Wednesday for expanded background checks on gun buyers and for a ban on assault weapons but the Senate rejected those central planks of legislation inspired by the shootings of 20 first-grade students and six teachers in Newtown, Conn. “Nobody believes that gun control by itself is going to end the horrors we have seen in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., Tucson, Ariz. and other American communities,” Sanders said. “There is a growing consensus, however, in Vermont and across America that we have got to do as much as we can to end the cold-blooded, mass murders of innocent people. I believe very strongly that we also have got to address the mental health crisis in our country and make certain that help is available for people who may be a danger to themselves and others,” Sanders added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Budget: President Obama’s proposal to cut Social Security “has caused a firestorm among supporters who now feel betrayed,” columnist George Curry wrote in The Philadelphia Tribune. “If Obama is serious about dealing with our deficit, he would not cut Social Security which has not added one penny to the deficit,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. “Instead, he would support legislation that ends the absurdity of one out of four profitable corporations paying nothing in federal income taxes. He would also help us close the offshore tax haven loopholes that enable large corporations and the wealthy to avoid paying $100 billion a year in federal taxes,” Sanders added.  Offshore Tax Havens: The Treasury loses an estimated $150 billion in revenue to offshore tax havens each year and, with support from Sen. Sanders and others, momentum is building to close the loophole, Joe Rasmussen wrote in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel column.   Veterans Benefits: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders on Tuesday proposed a bill to expand federal benefits for veterans in order to provide grief counseling, ensure benefits for remarried survivors, extend payments to survivors with children and expand benefits for children affected by Agent Orange, Military Times reported.   Global Warming: President Obama’s nominees to head the Energy Department and EPA faced Republican criticism at confirmation hearings. The real issue, according to Sen. Sanders, is “whether or not we are going to listen to the leading scientists of this country who are telling us that global warming is the most serious planetary crisis,” Public Radio International reported.

Do you favor or oppose changing the way the cost of living adjustments are calculated to reduce benefits for disabled veterans?
Medicare Rx Prices:  Legislation introduced on Tuesday would reduce Medicare prescription drug costs, protect seniors and lower the deficit. Sen. Bernie Sanders is a cosponsor of Sen. Jay Rockefeller’s bill that would eliminate a special deal for brand-name drug manufacturers that allows them to charge Medicare higher prices for prescription drugs for some seniors and people with disabilities. The bill would require drug companies to provide rebates to the federal government on drugs used by people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, mainly low-income seniors and people with disabilities.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Boston Bombings: Two powerful bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line on Monday. Three people were killed. More than 100 were hurt. The FBI in Boston said it was conducting “a potential terrorist investigation.” “Everyone in America is shocked and saddened and horrified,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on PBS. “What happened is a tragedy beyond words,” he said in the Burlington Free Press, Rutland Herald, Brattleboro Reformer, Bennington Banner and Valley News.   Obama Budget: Interviewed on MSNBC, Sen. Sanders reaffirmed his opposition to President Obama’s proposed cuts in Social Security and disabled veterans’ benefits and said members of Congress who side with Obama may pay a political price. “If people choose to go against what the vast majority of the people in their districts or state or this nation believe, they have to pay a price. What I can tell you is in the midst of a horrendous recession where the middle class is disappearing and the gap between people on top and everyone else is growing wider, the American people understand how important it is not to cut Social Security or benefits for disabled vets,” he told Chris Jansing.   Obama Budget: Interviewed on PBS, Sanders said the president “made a huge mistake” by proposing significant cuts in Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans. Obama’s proposal is “unconscionable” public policy and a “dangerous strategy” politically that is “going to hurt” the Democratic Party. “For the average American, Social Security has been is the pillar of the social safety net. It’s what the Democratic Party historically has been most proud of,” Sanders told Tavis Smiley. “What you are doing is surrendering to the Republican ideology rather than standing up and doing, in fact, what the vast majority of the American people want, and that is they want to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.”   Budget Hearings: Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew is set to appear before the House Budget Committee at 10 a.m. and the Senate Budget Committee at 3 p.m. to talk about President Obama’s $3.778 trillion spending plan. Lew may face tough questions in both chambers about the president’s proposals to means-test Medicare and use a less generous measure of the Consumer Price Index to calculate cost-of-living increases for recipients of Social Security, veterans’ benefits and other government programs. Sen. Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, is one of the most vociferous critics of what is called chained CPI, CQ-Roll Call reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Chairman Sanders: Bernard Sanders has embraced his new role as chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee with a populist gusto that has won him staunch backing from veterans groups. “I'm going to fight for them. I think they know it,” Sanders said during an interview with The Washington Post in his Capitol Hill office.   Obama’s Budget: Obama's plan to change how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated as a way to cut Social Security and other federal programs has raised hackles. United Press International said Sen. Sanders posted his view on his Facebook page. “I am deeply disappointed that the president's budget includes a chained consumer price index which would mean significant cuts for Social Security and veterans. It also would raise taxes on low- and middle-income Americans.”  Obama’s Budget: Republican Rep. Greg Walden was “laying political traps that will spring on the Democrats” when he condemned President Obama’s proposal to cut Social Security, John Nichols blogged for The Nation. MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough ripped Walden: “(He) attacked the president from the left. He was harsher than I think Bernie Sanders was,” Scarborough said.   U.S. Rethinks How to Respond to Nuclear Disaster: Two years after the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, the United States is using lessons from that disaster to rewrite its plans for responding to radiation contamination. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency expects to publish in the Federal Register a draft document that would change its long-standing advice to state and local governments about how to limit long-term exposure to radiation, The New York Times reported.

The 'Hoax': http://youtu.be/E13uELuWQi0
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Gas Prices: Burlington area gas prices are no longer 25-cents a gallon more than in the rest of Vermont, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday on WPTZ-TV. “That disparity is gone. I don’t want to see it return next week,” he added. Prices came down, Sanders said, because he and state lawmakers put a spotlight on what he called the “absurd disparity” in pump prices. “If the dealers here want to be competitive they can keep prices as low as anyplace else.”    Global Warming: Sen. Sanders said Gina McCarthy's confirmation hearing on her nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency was part of a Republican effort to stall action on climate change, the Pittsburgh Tribune Review reported.  “It's a debate about whether we are going to listen to science and address global warming." Sanders said in the Charleston Gazette. In The (Baton Rouge, La.) Advocate, Sanders called climate change the "most serious planetary crisis that we face.”  The ‘Hoax’: Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma does not want the EPA to curb climate change, Sen. Sanders wrote for The Huffington Post. Inhofe believes that global warming is one of the major hoaxes ever perpetrated on the American people. He blames Al Gore, the United Nations, and the Hollywood elite. He didn't dispute that at a Senate hearing this week. In fact, when Sanders asked him about it, Inhofe’s conspiracy theory thickened. "I would add to that list MoveOn.org, George Soros, Michael Moore, and a few others," Inhofe said.   Obama Cuts Social Security: President Obama wants to cut cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security after promising in his first campaign for the White House that he would’t do that. “In 2008 he said that he would not cut Social Security. We want the president to remember what he said and not go back on his word,” Sen. Sanders said Friday on CNN.

The Week in Review:   President Obama on Wednesday submitted a budget that would make significant cuts in Social Security and lower benefits for disabled veterans. “At a time when millions of working families are struggling economically, I am deeply disappointed,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs and a member of the Senate Budget Committee. Sanders on Wednesday welcomed the U.S. Postal Service decision to shelve its plan to end Saturday mail delivery. On Thursday he took on the Senate’s foremost global warming denier who dismisses scientific evidence of climate change as a “hoax.” Watch it here. Earlier in the week, Sanders on Tuesday introduced legislation to break up big banks deemed “too big to fail.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=2b3221ca-dcaa-49e0-8662-99a7f6f8593f

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: A confirmation hearing Thursday for President Obama’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency became a forum on global warming. “This is not a debate about Gina McCarthy,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. “It is a debate about global warming and whether we are going to listen to the leading scientists of this country who are telling us that global warming is the most serious planetary crisis we face,” The New York Times reported.   Sanders to EPA: Be Bold Sen. Sanders urged the EPA nominee to be aggressive in curbing climate change. “I want the EPA to be vigorous in protecting our children and future generations from the horrendous crisis that we face from global warming,” he said on National Public Radio’s All Things Considered.   The ‘Hoax’: A leading Republican on the environment committee, Sen. James Inhofe, has called global warming a “hoax” perpetrated by Al Gore, the United Nations and the “Hollywood elite.” Asked by Sen. Sanders if that was an accurate summary of his view, Inhofe went further. “I would add to that list Moveon.org, George Soros, Michael Moore and a few others,” Inhofe said, according to The New York Times and The Hill.    Obama Wants to Cut Social Security: President Obama’s budget would cut Social Security ostensibly to lower deficits, but Social Security has a $2.7 trillion surplus and can pay every benefit owed to every eligible recipient for two decades, Sen. Sanders told Thomas Roberts on MSNBC.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1ACF4ACB-E412-4B62-A2C8-88E4AEEC3037

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  USPS: The U.S. Postal Service backpedaled Wednesday on its plan to end Saturday mail delivery, "This is good news for rural communities, businesses, seniors, veterans and others who depend on consistent and timely delivery of the mail," Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a reports by The Associated Press and CQ-Roll Call and on ABC 22 in Burlington.   Big Banks: Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi has delved further than most into the debris left behind the financial meltdown on Wall Street in 2008. In addition to a $700 billion bailout approved by Congress, companies also took trillions of dollars in loans from the Federal Reserve. “This is something Bernie Sanders helped us find out when he and Ron Paul worked together to secure an audit of the Federal Reserve," Taibbi told Vermont Public Radio. He will join Sanders for two forum discussions in Burlington Friday.   Obama Budget Slammed: Prominent Democrats slammed President Obama's $3.8 trillion budget Wednesday for cutting Social Security. Sen. Sanders, who sponsored Senate budget amendment to reject changing the consumer price index to lower cost-of-living adjustments, said he would “do everything in my power to block President Obama's proposal.” As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Sanders said he is especially concerned about the impact on disabled veterans, The Boston Globe reported.   Obama: Breaks His Word "When Barack Obama was running for president in 2008, he said that he would not cut Social Security. We want the president to remember what he said and not go back on his word!" Sen. Sanders thundered at a protest outside the White House, according to an editorial in the Chicago Tribune.

Sanders Statement on Obama Budget:   “While the president’s budget has some positive elements like an increase in the minimum wage and increased revenue from people who make more than $250,000 a year, it is a document which does not effectively address the economic crisis facing our nation.  “At a time when millions of working families are struggling economically, I am deeply disappointed that the president’s budget includes a chained consumer price index which would mean significant cuts for Social Security and veterans. It also would raise taxes on low- and middle-income Americans.  “For seniors, Obama’s proposal would mean that a 65-year-old retiree would lose more than $650 a year by their 75th birthday and $1,000 a year would be cut from their benefits once they reach 85.  “For disabled veterans, someone who started receiving V.A. benefits at age 30 would have their benefits reduced by $1,425 a year at age 45, $2,341 at age 55 and $3,231 at age 65. “For taxpayers, the chained-CPI would increase taxes by $100 billion over the next decade and affect low-income and middle-class Americans the most. Americans making between $30,000 and $40,000 would receive the largest tax hike under the chained CPI.  “Lastly, at a time when real unemployment is 13.8 percent, the president’s budget does far too little to create the millions of jobs we desperately need.  While he proposed $50 billion to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, the truth is we need far more than that to improve our roads, bridges, railroad, water and wastewater systems.”
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama’s ‘Disappointing’ Budget: Sen. Sanders and leaders from senior, labor and women’s groups rallied outside the White House on Tuesday to oppose Social Security cuts proposed by President Obama. “I am extremely disappointed,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “Anybody in the Congress who believes in cutting these … benefits … may well not be returning to Washington,” Sanders said on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show. “We're not going to balance the budget on the backs of elderly, disabled vets, the sick or the children,” Sanders said on Current TV.   Obama’s ‘Betrayal’: President Obama’s proposed cuts “are a betrayal that stung so badly that Sen. Sanders literally took to the streets, joining left-wing activists for a protest outside the White House,” according to The Washington Post. “When Barack Obama was running for president in 2008, he said that he would not cut Social Security. We want the president to remember what he said and not go back on his word!” Sanders shouted into a microphone. Calling Obama’s offer “nuts,” Sanders went on: “The White House tells us they want to defend the middle class — that’s their mantra. If you want to defend the middle class you don’t cut Social Security, you don’t cut Medicare, and you don’t cut benefits for disabled vets,”   Obama’s Granny Tax: Sen. Sanders denounced the White House proposal to change how cost-of-living increases are calculated in order to cut Security by $130 billon over a decade while generating an additional $100 billion in revenue by moving taxpayers into higher tax brackets more quickly as their income rises. “This is not a minor tweak, as its proponents contend,” Sanders said in Congressional Quarterly. “Under Obama’s proposal, according to the Social Security Administration, 65-year-old retirees would lose more than $650 a year by their 75th birthday, and more than $1,000 a year would be cut from their benefits once they reach 85.”   Guess Who’s Not Coming to Dinner: Senate Republicans will break bread tonight with President Obama at the White House. On Tuesday, Sanders was standing outside the gates rebuking Obama for selling out seniors. “That jarring juxtaposition captures the upside-down political dynamic of Obama’s new budget proposal … [and] its … highly controversial plan to trim Social Security cost-of-living increases,” Politico reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  White House Protest: Sen. Bernie Sanders and leaders of organizations that oppose President Obama's anticipated assault on Social Security will go to the White House Tuesday to present petitions signed by more than one million Americans who reject the president's scheme to restructure cost-of-living adjustments in a way that would cut Social Security benefits for millions of seniors and veterans, John Nichols blogged for The Nation.   Don’t Cut Social Security: Whether a complete reversal of the values of the Democratic Party or a mystifying strategy that has many mainstream Democrats baffled and frustrated, the sentiment against cutting earned benefits such as Social Security is high. Sen. Sanders has promised to do everything in his power to block cuts to Social Security through backdoor methods such as changing how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated, CQ-Roll Call reported.   Don’t Cut Veterans Benefits: “As a military vet (retired), Social Security and Medicare beneficiary (all earned benefits), I feel significantly betrayed by congressional Republicans, some Democrats and the president for acceding and capitulating to Republicans’ intransigence and excessive demands … and I urge Bernie Sanders to rally strong and universal support against the chained CPI concept, Sam Conant wrote in a letter to the editor of the Rutland Herald.   Big Banks: Sen. Sanders and Rep. Brad Sherman will hold news conference today at the Capitol to announce legislation to break up big banks, according to The Associated Press Daybook. The 10 largest banks are bigger now than before a taxpayer bailout following the 2008 financial crisis and financial institutions have grown so big that the Justice Department has not pursued prosecutions for fear an indictment would harm the financial system.

Bernard Sanders holds a town hall meeting this week in Burlington to take on the country’s ‘too big to fail, too big to jail’ banks, he’ll be joined in his quest by Rolling Stone investigative reporter Matt Taibbi. Taibbi … has written extensively about the role Wall Street banks played in the financial collapse of 2008 and the continuing abuses."  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=1dc2c5c1-1753-4383-980f-ddb54a0e2d18
Today's News from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  White House Budget Draws Fire - President Barack Obama’s plan to alter federal cost-of-living adjustments to reduce the growth of future benefits from Social Security and other federal programs risks widening a rift within his own party. "This is attacking the middle class at a time when the middle class is in great duress," Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. For Democrats up for re-election in 2014, "I don't think this is going to reverberate terribly well with their base," he added. Sanders said he would oppose any efforts to lower payments to Social Security beneficiaries, Reuters reported on Sunday and National Public Radio reported on Monday.  Obama Reneges on Social Security - President Obama’s plan to cut Social Security benefits is meeting “a lot of resistance” from Sen. Bernie Sanders,” George Stephanopoulos told White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer on Sunday on the ABC News program This Week. “Sanders is a passionate advocate,” Pfeiffer said. On Fox News Sunday, The Daily Beast’s Kirsten Powers said “the left is very angry” at the White House. “Bernie Sanders has come out and said I will do everything I can ...to stop this from going through,” she added.  A Better Approach - “If Obama is serious about dealing with our deficit, he would not cut Social Security - which has not added one penny to the deficit," Sanders said. "Instead, he would support legislation that ends the absurdity of one out of four profitable corporations paying nothing in federal income taxes. He would also help us close the offshore tax haven loopholes that enable large corporations and the wealthy to avoid paying $100 billion a year in federal taxes," The Washington Times reported.  Sanders, Taibbi: Break Up Big Banks - Sen. Sanders and Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi will hold two town meetings in Burlington this Friday to discuss the impact of Wall Street greed on our economy. Taibbi, who has written extensively about the role Wall Street banks played in the financial collapse of 2008 and the continuing abuses, will lend his support to Sanders’ bill to be introduced this week to dismantle the nation’s largest financial institutions, the Rutland Herald reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders ‘Terribly Disappointed’: President Obama would cut Social Security benefits in a 2014 budget that he described on Saturday in his weekly address as "not my ideal plan." Sen. Bernie Sanders opposed Obama’s cuts. "I am terribly disappointed and will do everything in my power to block President Obama's proposal to cut benefits for Social Security recipients," said Sanders in reports by CBS News online, WRGB-TV in Albany, N.Y., other CBS affiliates and Agence France Presse.    Obama Breaks Promise to Seniors: Sen. Sanders said that President Obama back in 2008 promised that he would not cut Social Security, Fox News reported on Saturday. Sanders said millions of people will be extremely disappointed if the president “caves on this issue,” according to another Fox News report. Sanders “was very upset about the president sort of agreeing to already lower the cost-of-living adjustment for seniors on their Social Security,” The Washington Post’s David Nakamura said on MSNBC on Saturday.   ’08 Obama Opposed Cuts: As Obama's chief opponent in the debate over how to adjust for inflation, Sanders has taken an approach that polls show Americans prefer. At a news conference last month, Sanders replayed a video clip of Obama in 2008, during his first run for president, vowing not to cut the cost-of-living adjustment. "Well, this is the Barack Obama that I agree with," Sanders said in an article published in Sunday’s Los Angeles Times.

CBS News: Obama Proposes Cuts to Social Security http://youtu.be/akKCflXzYKw
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Wants to Cut Social Security: President Obama will ask Congress to slow the growth of Social Security benefits by changing the way the government measures inflation. The plan would save the government $130 billion over 10 years, but over that same decade a 65-year-old retiree could expect to see his or her annual benefits at age 75 be $650 lower than the current formula. Sen. Bernie Sanders is among those who have been outspoken against using Social Security to cut the deficit. “What the Republicans want to do is decimate the social safety net in America. They want to decimate Social Security and President Obama has succumbed to what they have wanted for years and that’s very disappointing,” Sanders said on the CBS Evening News.   Sanders: A Terrible Disappointment: President Obama will propose a budget next week that courts Republicans for a grand bargain on the debt while angering Democratic allies with cuts to Social Security and other programs. "I remember when Obama said he was concerned about retirees struggling to get by and was unequivocal in his opposition to cutting cost-of-living adjustments," Sen. Sanders said in The Washington Post. “I am terribly disappointed,” Sanders said in The Wall Street Journal, Reuters and WPTZ-TV reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama to Cut Social Security: President Obama's proposed budget will call for reductions in Social Security and other benefit programs by lowering cost-of-living adjustments. “In 2008, candidate Barack Obama told the American people that he would not cut Social Security. Having him go back on his word will only add to the rampant political cynicism that our country is experiencing today,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in The Washington Post online. “Millions of working people, seniors, disabled veterans, those who have lost a loved one in combat, and women will be extremely disappointed if President Obama caves into the long standing Republican effort to cut Social Security,” Sanders said, according to Politico and Bloomberg Businessweek.  “Bernie Sanders head is going to explode when he sees this,” ABC News White House correspondent Jonathan Karl said on WLS-AM in Chicago.

Sanders to Obama: Don't Cut Benefits for Seniors and Disabled Veterans:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday urged President Obama to keep his promise not to cut Social Security benefits. A change in how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated also would cut benefits for disabled veterans. “Millions of working people, seniors, disabled veterans, those who have lost a loved one in combat, and women will be extremely disappointed if President Obama caves into the long standing Republican effort to cut Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans and their survivors through a so-called chained CPI,” said Sanders “In 2008, candidate Barack Obama told the American people that he would not cut Social Security. Having him go back on his word will only add to the rampant political cynicism that our country is experiencing today.”  “If Obama is serious about dealing with our deficit he would not cut Social Security – which has not added one penny to the deficit.

He would also help us close the offshore tax haven loopholes that enable large corporations and the wealthy to avoid paying $100 billion a year in federal taxes.”  President Obama is expected to release the details of his budget plan on Wednesday, April 10.  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=28E428A4-A4F4-4BDD-AB35-4F1D4AFB9B8B
Too Big to Jail? - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/too-big-to-jail_b_2973641.html
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Too Big to Fail: Momentum is building in Washington toward reforming the banks. Sen. Bernie Sanders announced plans to introduce a bill that would give Treasury Secretary Jack Lew 90 days to compile a list of any financial institution “that has grown so large that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy without substantial government assistance.” The bill comes in the wake of Attorney General Eric Holder’s statement that prosecuting big banks may have a "negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy,” Matt Taibbi blogged for Rolling Stone.  Too Big to Jail: “We are supposed to be a country of laws. The laws should apply to Wall Street as well as everybody else. So I was stunned when our country's top law enforcement official recently suggested it might be difficult to prosecute financial institutions that commit crimes because it may destabilize the financial system of our country and the world,” Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a column posted Wednesday at Daily Kos, Op-Ed News, MichaelMoore.com and Green Mountain Daily.   Can Obama Keep a Promise?: A change to the way inflation is measured could help President Obama and Republicans cut a debt-reduction deal this summer. Obama's 2014 budget blueprint, due out Wednesday, might include a proposed switch to a chained consumer price index. He supported such a change in negotiations with House Speaker John Boehner, but during his first campaign for president he pledged not to cut Social Security. “I hope he remembers that promise and keeps it," Sen. Sanders wrote in a New York Times letter to the editor, CNN reported online.   Health Care: Before Vermont may adopt a single-payer health care system the state must get a waiver from the federal government, a process set to begin in 2017. Sen. Sanders wants the waiver three years sooner. During a forum broadcast by C-SPAN, Dr. Theodore Brown of Rochester Medical Center supported Sanders’ effort. “We know that on the ground, the representatives at the commercial insurance industry are creating confusion and distortion. The longer they have to spread their particular propaganda, the more the wind will be taken out of the single-payer sails,” he said.

Dear Mr. President: Keep Promise on Social Security:   President Barack Obama has floated the idea of cutting benefits for Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and other programs that are adjusted for inflation.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on Wednesday that Obama’s offer to Speaker John Boehner to change the consumer price index is still “on the table.” Sen. Bernie Sanders is a leading opponent of the proposal to take billions of dollars away from retirees, disabled veterans and others by changing how cost-of-living adjustments are calculated.

Climate Change:   “What the scientists tell us is that the projections they made about the damage for global warming were wrong. They understated the problem. What they’re now saying is that if we don’t get our act together and start cutting greenhouse gas emissions in a very significant way we’re talking about this planet heating up by eight degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. And that is calamitous for this planet. We have got to do something about it,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Monday on the premier of “All In With Chris Hayes” on MSNBC.

Today's news from Sen.

Bernie Sanders wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times published on Tuesday. “During his first run for the White House, in 2008, Mr. Obama said he would not cut Social Security. I hope he remembers that promise and keeps it,” Sanders wrote.   White House Budget: White House sources say the president is “strongly considering” including cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in his 2014 budget to be introduced later this month. In futile negotiations with Republicans, the White House reportedly has been offering a new, stingier, so-called chained consumer price index. “No one in the Senate wants his or her name on chained CPI: 10 days ago by voice vote they backed a measure by Sen. Sanders specifically opposing a switch to the chained CPI. No voice was raised on the other side,” Joan Walsh wrote for Salon.   Global Warming: Sen. Sanders on Monday renewed his opposition to a pipeline that would pump crude oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and worsen global warming. Interviewed on MSNBC, Sanders said the U.S. should be developing solar, wind and other renewable energy sources and not looking backward toward crude oil. “We now can do it. If there was a political will in the White House and in the Congress, we can transform the energy system. We can create millions of jobs. We could lead the world and be an exporter around the world of that type of technology. That's the future, not oil.   Too Big to Jail: Activists will deliver petitions to Department of Justice offices around the country on Tuesday, calling on President Barack Obama to crack down on big banks. The move comes after nearly a month of vocal backlash against Attorney General Eric Holder's admission that some financial institutions are simply too big to prosecute, The Huffington Post reported. Most Americans think banks have grown too big, according to a second Huffington Post article that also noted Sen. Sanders’ plan to introduce legislation to split banks apart.

Sen. Bernie Sanders succeeded in getting the Senate to approve an amendment last week against changing how cost-of-living increases are calculated for Social Security recipients as well as disabled veterans.   Social Security, Past, Present and Future: In last year’s “fiscal cliff” debate, President Obama offered to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits, a spending cut favored by Republicans and scorned by Democrats. “The question now is whether Mr. Obama will again propose to cut the COLA when he unveils his budget next week,” wrote the New York Times editorial board in a column Sunday.”   Oil Spill in Arkansas: Crews cleaned up thousands of barrels of crude over the weekend after an Exxon Mobil Corp. pipeline ruptured and polluted an Arkansas town. Exxon said Friday's breach caused a few thousand barrels of oil to spill into Mayflower, a town of less than 3,000 about 25 miles northwest of Little Rock.

Must Read: Social Security, Present and Future - The New York Times  In the fight over the federal budget deficit, Social Security has so far been untouched. That may soon change.  In last year’s “fiscal cliff” debate, President Obama offered to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security benefits, a spending cut favored by Republicans and scorned by Democrats. Republicans rejected the offer because Mr. Obama wanted tax increases in exchange, while Democrats said it would be too harmful. More recently, Senate Democrats did not include Social Security reforms in their budget and specifically rejected a COLA cut. The House Republican budget also steered clear of explicit cuts to Social Security, a move partly aimed at isolating Mr. Obama.  The question now is whether Mr. Obama will again propose to cut the COLA when he unveils his budget next week. We think he should not do so. The president might want to seem like he is willing to compromise by renewing his call for a COLA cut. But Republicans already spurned his offer and are unlikely to take him up on it now. They are more likely to paint him as a foe of Social Security, which would be reinforced by Democrats’ opposition to the cut.  Even if Mr. Obama avoided those pitfalls, a COLA cut is a bad idea, as we will explain in this editorial. It also is a distraction from the real problems of Social Security.

There are more than 5,000 banks in the United States. However, just 12 big banks control about 69 percent of the banking industry. Would you favor or oppose a plan to break up the big banks?
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  A Win for Veterans: During a marathon budget session this month, the Senate approved an amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, opposing a cut in veterans’ benefits, the Chicago Tribune reported on Sunday. The vote put the Senate on record against the proposal that President Barack Obama had floated as a way also to reduce costs for Social Security and other federal programs that are adjusted for inflation. "My own view is you don't balance the budget on the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in this country," Sanders said.  Sanders Warns Obama: Sen. Sanders is troubled by the president’s plan to change benefit calculations for disability benefits, WPTZ-TV reported on Saturday. Sanders recently warned Obama that every veterans group he knows of has come out strongly against the proposal, according to an Associated Press report in Sunday’s Burlington Free Press, Rutland Herald, Times Argus and Valley News.    Don’t Cut Social Security: “Cutting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and disabled veterans through a so-called chained CPI would make it much harder for the average senior living on $1,200 a month to make ends meet, while doing very little to improve Social Security's finances,” Sanders said in a letter to the editor of the Burlington County (N.J.)

Too Big to Jail? - By Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  We are supposed to be a country of laws. The laws should apply to Wall Street as well as everybody else. So I was stunned when our country's top law enforcement official recently suggested it might be difficult to prosecute financial institutions that commit crimes because it may destabilize the financial system of our country and the world.  "I am concerned," Attorney General Eric Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee, "that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute -- if we do bring a criminal charge -- it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy."  The attorney general was talking about some of the same financial institutions that received billions, and in some cases trillions, of dollars in taxpayer bailouts after their greed, recklessness and illegal behavior plunged the country into a terrible recession. Over my opposition, Congress approved a $700 billion taxpayer bailout of financial institutions that were on the brink of collapse which some in Congress considered "too big to fail."

Sanders’ amendment to the budget resolution put the Senate on record in opposition changing how consumer prices are measured, Forbes reported online.  Social Security: “Making millionaires pay the same percentage of their income into Social Security as someone earning $113,000 would extend the life of Social Security for generations to come without the need to cut benefits or raise taxes on the middle class. That adds up to me, and that's why I've introduced legislation to do just that,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a letter to the editor of the Hattiesburg (Miss.) American in response to a syndicated column.   Energy Efficiency: A $1 million grant secured by Sen. Sanders established a pilot project to help businesses finance energy-efficiency improvements, the Burlington Free Press, WPTZ-TV, ABC 22 and Fox 44 reported.

Too Big to Jail: “We are supposed to be a country of laws. The laws should apply to Wall Street as well as everybody else,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column for The Huffington Post.   USPS: Sen. Sanders asked the postmaster general to give up on a plan to end Saturday mail delivery, a step the Government Accountability Office has said would be illegal, he said Thursday on The Ed Schultz Show.   Chained CPI: President Obama’s pursuits of a chained consumer price index to slash Social Security benefits have been, so far, successfully resisted by Sen. Sanders and allies in Congress, The Fiscal Times reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=B0D521A8-4E13-4281-8EE3-20E20C4EFCAD
Sanders Bill Would Break Up Big Banks Cites Justice Dept. Worries that Banks are ‘Too Big to Jail’: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=5f3ec2b2-fd30-4386-9121-4a25e46fc62d
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Too Big to Jail: Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday he will introduce legislation to break up the nation’s mega-banks. Sanders said the banks have grown so big that the Justice Department has refused to pursue prosecutions for fear an indictment would harm the financial system, the Times Argus reported online. “We have a situation now where Wall Street banks are not only too big to fail, they are too big to jail,” Sanders said in an article for Forbes online.    USPS: Sen. Sanders demanded that the U.S. Postal Service publicly acknowledge that it has no legal right to end Saturday delivery service. “I am urging you to make it clear to the American people that the USPS will continue Saturday mail delivery in adherence with the law,” Sanders wrote Tuesday in a letter to Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe, The Hill reported online.   Energy Secretary: Ernest Moniz is unlikely to have much trouble being confirmed as energy secretary, despite continued complaints from some environmental groups about his financial ties to oil, gas and nuclear companies. Sens. Sanders, Al Franken and Martin Heinrich are the committee members most likely to chime in on Moniz's past statements supporting natural gas as a bridge from coal to renewable, according to Politico.   Gay Marriage: A majority of Supreme Court justices expressed reservations Wednesday about a law which prohibits federal benefits to same-sex married couples. A ruling is expected by June. While the court held a second day of oral arguments on gay marriage, Sen. Sanders’ campaign got involved in a social media promotion for marriage equality, Forbes and The Boston Globe reported online.

Gay Marriage:  The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case about whether married same-sex couples are entitled to federal benefits. “I hope the court strikes down the so-called Defense of Marriage Act. It was a bad idea when it was enacted in 1996. That’s why I voted against the law in the first place and why I am a cosponsor today of a bill to repeal the discriminatory law,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. Sanders and other members of the Senate and House on March 1 filed a friend-of-the court brief saying the law “imposed a sweeping and unjustifiable federal disability on married same-sex couples” in a manner that “lacks any rational connection to legitimate federal interests”  A ruling is expected by June on whether the federal government may, as the law requires, legally discriminate against gay and lesbian couples married in Vermont, eight other states or the District of Columbia where same-sex marriage is now legal. Sanders voted against the law when it passed the House in 1996. Today, he is a cosponsor of Senate legislation to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies tens of thousands of legally married same-sex couples the same rights afforded legally married men and women under more than 1,000 federal laws and regulations.   The court on Tuesday also considered a separate case involving California’s ban on same-sex marriage. http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=0C92CD62-EAE9-4DDF-9B2A-79729FBFE2F1

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Defense of Marriage Act: The Supreme Court on Wednesday continues its examination of same-sex marriage, this time considering whether Congress may withhold federal benefits from legally wed gay couples by defining marriage as only between a man and a woman. The Obama administration has said that it will not defend the law, The Washington Post reported.   Saturday Mail: Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on the postmaster general to withdraw his plan to end six-day mail service. Sanders said the Postal Service has no legal authority to end Saturday deliveries without the approval of Congress. He cited a legal opinion from the Government Accountability Office, WPTZ-TV reported.   A Win for Seniors, Veterans: Advocates for seniors and unions scored a win in their fight against entitlement cuts last week when Sen. Sanders offered a budget amendment that opposed cutting safety net programs for veterans by using a less generous measure of inflation known as the chained consumer price index. The measure was approved by voice vote, so it’s hard to tell how many senators backed it. That said, the upper chamber is now on record against chained CPI, which President Obama has put on the negotiating table with Republicans during deficit talks, The Hill reported.   Tax Havens: Sen. Sanders introduced a bill that would restore lost revenue from overseas tax shelters and make it more difficult for wealthy individuals to escape tax liability through offshore entities, according to The New York Times online.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Social Security: A Senate vote for an amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders put the Senate on record against cutting Social Security and disabled veterans benefits, The Washington Times and Daily Kos reported online. The amendment rejected a revision to the consumer price index that would change how inflation is measured. “This is a strong signal that when push comes to shove the Senate is going to oppose any effort to balance the budget on the backs of seniors, disabled veterans and their survivors,” Sanders said on Monday.    Global Warming: Senate liberals haven't given up on forcing votes on steps that would take on greenhouse gases directly. Senate Environment and Public Works Chairwoman Barbara Boxer hopes for a floor vote by this summer on legislation by Sen. Sanders that would put a price on climate emissions, according to Politico.   Older Americans: Sen. Sanders “scored a modest — if largely symbolic — victory for older Americans as the Senate pulled an all-nighter last Friday to debate and vote on budget amendments. Sanders, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that deals with aging-related issues, sponsored an amendment to the budget resolution backing the Older Americans Act that was approved by unanimous consent,” according to an AARP blog.   USPS: Legislation to fund the government through Sept. 30 included a provision requiring the United States Postal Service to maintain six-day delivery. Sen. Sanders continues to argue for a repeal of an onerous congressional mandate that forces USPS to pre-fund future retiree benefits, KOLO-TV in Reno, Nev.,reported.

Doctor Crisis  “We need many thousands of new primary care doctors now and, by some accounts, 50,000 more within a decade. But the deck is stacked against a big increase, given medical school cultures that push students toward specialization; a system in which Medicare sets the baseline for doctors’ pay; and a federally-mandated limit on medical residents positions since 1997,” according to Sunday’s New York Daily News. “It’s a wildly irrational system,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said. “We do not need more specialists. We need primary care physicians in rural and poor urban areas, not on Park Avenue.” Sanders chairs a Senate committee on primary health care.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: We all buy stuff that generates carbon dioxide emissions and threatens the stability of our climate. We don’t directly pay the resulting costs. A tax on carbon consumption could help solve the problem. A new Climate Protection Act introduced by Sens. Bernard Sanders and Barbara Boxer proposes such a tax. About 60 percent of the revenues would be returned directly to consumers, 25 percent allotted to deficit reduction and 15 percent devoted to investments in renewable energy, University of Massachusetts economist Nancy Folbre wrote for The New York Times online.   Climate Change: A coalition of liberals in Congress hopes to move climate change to the top of the agenda, despite little hope of any significant legislation passing. One step is the formation of a climate change caucus by Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sen. Sanders and Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer have separately introduced legislation to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions. Boxer has said she hopes to bring it to the floor this summer, Politico reported.   Senate Budget Shields Social Security: The Senate early Saturday morning narrowly passed a budget that included a measure by Sen. Sanders that put the Senate on record opposing changing the formula by which Social Security benefits are calculated, Talk Radio News Service reported.   Tax Havens: A bill proposed by Sen. Sanders would limit the ability of American businesses to shelter overseas income from taxation back home. It would also make it more difficult for Americans to escape tax liability by using offshore corporate entities, the International Herald Tribune reported on Monday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Doctor Shortage: Thousands of new primary care doctors are needed now and, by some accounts, 50,000 more within a decade. But the deck is stacked against a big increase, given medical school cultures that push students toward specialization; a system in which Medicare sets the baseline for doctors’ pay; and a federally-mandated limit on medical residents positions since 1997. “It’s a wildly irrational system,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told the New York Daily News. His Senate committee’s troubling report says a severe primary care shortage will grow sharply next year and more people will die simply because they don’t see a doctor.   Global Warming: A crowd of about 550 people attended a daylong symposium on global warming in Montpelier to hear from environmentalist Bill McKibben, Sen. Sanders, and others. “I was very, very impressed by how many Vermonters were prepared to come out, learn more and figure out how we can go forward,” Sanders told the Burlington Free Press in an interview published Sunday.   Senate Approves Budget: Sen. Sanders and his colleagues pulled an all-nighter and approved a new federal budget at 5 a.m. Saturday. By a tight vote of 50 to 49, the Senate adopted the $3.7 trillion spending plan which includes an amendment sponsored by Sanders supporting the Older Americans Act, a landmark law that supports Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors, WPTZ-TV reported on Saturday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Rejects Obama’s ‘Grand Bargain’ Centerpiece: The Senate voted Friday to oppose cutting benefits for Social Security and disabled veterans. President Obama had put a stingier consumer price index on the table in deficit talks with Republicans. Sen. Bernie Sanders sponsored the amendment to the Senate budget resolution, The Hill and Congressional Quarterly reported. The vote was “a victory for Vermont's junior senator,” WPTZ-TV said. Senate Majority Leader Reid, not a big fan of chained CPI, sat beside Sanders on the floor following the vote on that amendment, National Journal reported.   Gore for Carbon Tax: “The time has come’ for a carbon tax,” former Vice President Al Gore declared, according to The Daily Caller. Sen. Sanders’ Climate Protection Act, the online article added, would put a fee on carbon to combat climate change.   USPS: Responsible members of Congress, led by Sen. Sanders, are fighting to save Saturday mail service and to free the Postal Service to compete, John Nichols blogged for The Nation.

BREAKING: Senate Opposes ‘Chained CPI’ Cuts to Social Security, Veterans’ Benefits:   The Senate tonight voted to block cuts in benefits for Social Security and disabled veterans.  The amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) put the Senate on record against changing how cost-of-living increases are calculated in a way that would result in significant cuts.  “The time has come for the Senate to send a very loud and clear message to the American people: We will not balance the budget on the backs of disabled veterans who have lost their arms, their legs and their eyesight defending our country. We will not balance the budget on the backs of the men and women who have already sacrificed for us in Iraq and Afghanistan, nor on the widows who have lost their husbands in Iraq and Afghanistan defending our country,” Sanders said.   The amendment opposed switching from the current method of measuring inflation to a so-called chained consumer price index. President Barack Obama favors a chained CPI as part of what the White House calls a “grand bargain” that Obama hopes to reach with congressional Republicans.

The Week in Review:   Senators worked into Friday night on a budget resolution that would cut the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years. The budget blueprint includes nearly $1 trillion in tax increases and protects priorities like education and health research from cuts sought by House Republicans. The Senate was expected to vote Friday evening on amendments by Sen. Bernie Sanders. One would put the Senate on record against cutting benefits for Social Security and disabled veterans. The other would take a stand against offshore tax havens that are used by profitable corporations and wealthy individuals to shelter income, a tax loophole that costs about $100 billion a year.  On Wednesday, Sanders chaired a hearing on how veteran suicides and how the Department of Veterans Affairs is caring for troops returning from war zones.  Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the war in Iraq, which Sanders had voted against as a member of the House.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Budget: The Democratic-controlled Senate is on track to pass a budget with almost $1 trillion in tax increases while protecting safety-net programs for the poor and popular domestic priorities like education and health research from cuts sought by House Republicans, who adopted a far more austere plan on Thursday. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray crafted a measure designed to nail down support from senators like Bernie Sanders who vehemently oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare, The Associated Press reported.   Don’t Cut Social Security: Sen. Sanders is continuing his push against changing the way increases in Social Security benefits are calculated, Congressional Quarterly reported. He has an amendment to ban the use of a so-called chained consumer price index, a new way of calculating inflation that would lower Social Security benefits and reduce the value of tax breaks. President Obama has put the proposal on the table in deficit talks with Republicans, but the Senate budget core text is silent on them. The Hill reported.   End Offshore Tax Havens: Sen. Sanders said Thursday that he would offer an amendment to the budget that would target offshore tax havens utilized by U.S. corporations. Sanders said his amendment would create a reserve fund by collecting taxes on the offshore accounts and use that new revenue to reduce the deficit and invest in job creation. “It’s time for large corporations to pay their fair share,” Sanders said Thursday during floor debate on the Senate budget, The Hill reported.   Bad Bargain: Sen. Sanders has gone on record opposing any deal that would cut Social Security and Medicare in exchange for revenue increases. Blogging for Mother Jones, Kevin Drum downplayed the dangers of a “grand bargain” that he considered unlikely to attract enough votes in Congress.

Chained CPI: An economic, moral disaster -

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Warns Syria, Congress Warns Obama: World powers rushed Wednesday to investigate reports of a chemical weapon attack in Aleppo, Syria. President Barack Obama told a news conference in Jerusalem that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would change U.S. policy and require action from the international community. In Washington, senators in both parties made it clear that they want the White House to consult with Congress before taking action in Syria, particularly if it involves U.S. military intervention. Sen. Bernie Sanders told Congressional Quarterly there is strong opposition in the country to any more wars. “Today we acknowledged the 10th anniversary of the war in Iraq, the significant loss of life. ... I don’t think the American people are anxious to get into another war.”   Veterans Mental Health: Sen. Sanders chaired a hearing Wednesday to examine whether veterans have timely access to quality mental health care, the Burlington Free Press reported. About 22 veterans commit suicide every day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Sanders said a key role is played by organizations such as the Vermont Veterans Outreach Program which provides assistance to returning veterans and their families. The Vermont program relies on a team of 10 combat veterans who have had to cope with adjusting to life at home after fighting overseas, said Andre Wing, the program’s team leader.   Wind Power: The Vermont Senate delayed a vote on a bill that would subject renewable energy projects to more regulation, Vermont Public Radio reported. Sen. Sanders stepped into the fray last month, expressing opposition to what he and others see as an obstacle to wind power projects in Vermont. Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, said he's on the side of the majority Vermonters, not just the renewable industry. “We're standing with real champions on climate and energy issues like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Bill McKibben,” Burns said in the Valley News. A Rutland Herald column and a letter to the editor commented on the controversy.   Grand Bargain: “Which is worse, indefinite sequestration or a grand bargain that includes serious entitlement cuts?  Sen. Sanders and Rep. Keith Ellison, staunch foes of a grand bargain that cuts entitlement benefits, have argued that it’s premature to get drawn into this choice. I hope they’re right [but] … it seems to me that progressives who oppose such a grand bargain might at least start marshaling a policy argument for why the sequester is a preferable — or at least a less horrible — alternative.” Greg Sergeant blogged for The Washington Post.

LIVE: Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget: The Senate is expected to debate a budget that balances spending cuts with increased revenue by closing corporate tax loopholes. “Why in God’s name would we want to cut Social Security and Medicare and all of these programs that are so terribly important to middle-income Americans, working Americans, when you have one out of four major corporations in this country not paying a nickel in taxes?” Sen. Bernie Sanders asked Tuesday on The Ed Schultz Radio Show.   Iraq War: On the 10th anniversary of the Iraq war, Sen. Sanders reflected on his vote against House resolutions authorizing the use of force. "I think history will record that as the right vote,” Sanders said. “Looking back, I think the war was a mistake. I think the vote I made 10 years ago was the right choice. I hope it’s a lesson that we will learn for the future,” Sanders said on The Ed Schultz Show.   Wind Power: The Vermont Senate is slated to debate a measure that one side says aims to strengthen reviews of ridge-top wind power projects and the other says would bring development of renewable energy to a halt. The legislation has divided environmentalists, according to Vermont Public Radio. “We're standing with real champions on climate and energy issues like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Bill McKibben,” said Paul Burns of Vermont Public Interest Research Group.   VA Claims: Backlog Sen. Sanders chaired a Senate Veterans’ Committee hearing last week on Veterans Affairs Department efforts to reduce a backlog of claims for disability benefits. Sanders called the situation "absolutely unacceptable," but also expressed support for the VA's efforts – led by Gen. Eric Shinseki – to improve accuracy and the speed with which claims are processed, The St. Albans Messenger reported.

Grand bargain could be grand sellout - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  The media appear fixated about when and if a so-called “grand bargain” on our economy will be reached. Wrong question! The question we should be asking is: What should be in a “grand bargain” that works for the average American?  At a time when the middle class is disappearing, 46 million Americans are living in poverty and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, we need a “grand bargain” that protects struggling working families, not billionaires.  With corporate profits at record-breaking levels while the effective corporate tax is at its lowest level since 1972, and 1 out of 4 profitable corporations pays nothing in federal income taxes, we need a grand bargain that ends corporate loopholes and demands that corporate America starts helping us with deficit reduction. We must not balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. We must not cut Social Security, disabled veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, education and other programs that provide opportunity and dignity to millions of struggling American families.  Before we pass a grand bargain, we have got to take a hard and sober look at what’s happening economically in our country today. In doing so, we must acknowledge that the United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on earth and that inequality is worse today than at any time since the late 1920s. Today, the wealthiest 400 individuals in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of America — 150 million Americans. The top 1 percent owns 38 percent of all financial wealth, while the bottom 60 percent owns just 2.3 percent. Incredibly, the Federal Reserve reported last year that median net worth for middle-class families dropped by nearly 40 percent from 2007-2010. That’s the equivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for the average middle-class family.   The distribution of income is even worse. If you can believe it, the last study on the subject showed that all of the new income gained from 2009-2011 went to the top 1 percent. ALL of the new income!

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders’ Budget Priorities: “We need a budget that puts millions of Americans back to work in decent-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure … keeps the promises we have made to our seniors, veterans and the most vulnerable … [and] makes sure that the wealthiest Americans and most profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,” Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a Tuesday column for The Hill.   Budget Differences: Bridged House and Senate leaders appear to have minimized defections on their budget plans in a show of strength ahead of fiscal fights this summer. Sen. Patty Murray, chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee, crossed possibly the biggest hurdle when she won the backing of Sen. Sanders and centrists including Sens. Mark Warner and Angus King to send the budget resolution to the floor, according to The Hill.   Citizens United: Sen. Sanders introduced a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Citizens United ruling that makes it easier for corporations to hijack political elections, The Huffington Post and Campus Progress reported.   Progressive Caucus: When Sen. Sanders was first elected to Congress in 1990, he was uncertain about the role he could play. “I thought that what we needed was a caucus that said ‘We are standing with the working families of this country,’” Sanders told In These Times. Today, the Congressional Progressive Caucus has 72 members, the largest Democratic caucus, and it is again proposing alternatives in a city where the notion of balancing the budget on the backs of those most in need is rarely challenged.

Global Warming:   More than 500 people were at Montpelier High School on Saturday for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ conference on global warming. “We can make real progress if we move away from coal, if we move away from oil, if we move to sustainable energy, if we move to energy efficiency and, by the way, when we do that we are also going to create a whole lot of jobs in the United States of America,” Sanders said. Vermont, the senator added, can set an example for the rest of the country. “We can be a leader in showing the rest of the country what sensible energy policy is about,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Postal Service: U.S. Postal Service plans to suspend Saturday delivery to cut mounting debt drew opposition from Vermont’s congressional delegation at a rally in South Burlington on Sunday, The Associated Press reported. “You keep the economy going,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told the crowd, according to the Burlington Free Press. Sanders is the primary sponsor of a bill that would repeal a 2006 law that mandated the Postal Service pre-fund 75 years of future health care benefits for retirees.   Saturday Mail: Sen. Sanders “received a standing ovation when he walked into the letter carrier's rally,” WPTZ-TV reported.  Vermont's 300 letter carriers “have a friend in the Capitol in Sanders who introduced a bill to save six-day service by fixing the postal service's budget woes,” Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported. Sanders said small things like being able to notarize official documents could help rural post offices bring in revenue, WCAX-TV reported.  Global Warming: Organizers say more than 500 people were at Montpelier High School on Saturday to talk about global warming. Sen. Sanders hopes to inspire the younger crowd to start thinking about what can be done to reverse climate change. “We can make real progress if we move away from coal, if we move away from oil, if we move to sustainable energy, if we move to energy efficiency and, by the way, when we do that we are also going to create a whole lot of jobs in the United States of America,” he said.  Sanders recently introduced climate change legislation that includes a tax on carbon, WPTZ-TV reported on Monday.   Sequester: Lawmakers are angry about the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps decisions to cancel tuition assistance for the rest of the fiscal year. “I know that these are tough times, but I’m not sure that’s the way you want to save money,” Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, told Politico when asked about the severance of tuition assistance.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Climate Change: "Scientists are telling us that if we don't get our act together, that if we don’t cut back our carbon emissions, the temperature of the planet earth with rise by 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century, and 8 degrees is catastrophic," Sanders said on Fox 44 and ABC 22. Vermonters are finding ways to reduce energy consumption. “We can be a leader in showing the rest of the country what sensible energy policy is about,” Sanders said on WCAX-TV. He has introduced legislation that includes a tax on carbon emissions and ends subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, The Associated Press reported.   Saturday Mail: Vermonters concerned about the Postal Service’s plans to end Saturday mail delivery are holding a rally Sunday in South Burlington.  Sen. Sanders is expected to speak at the event. "The Postal Service, no question, is extraordinarily important for our economy. We have got to fight to maintain rural post offices and delivery service centers as well,” he told ABC 22.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Global Warming Conference: A conference today on the local and global effects of climate change organized by Sen. Bernie Sanders will feature Ripton-based author and activist Bill McKibben as its keynote speaker, the Burlington Free Press reported on Saturday. “In my view, Vermont can and must be a leader in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy,” Sanders said. LINK Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders will hold a conference this weekend in Montpelier focused on the regional impacts of climate change.  Sanders Confronts Obama on Social Security Cuts: During one of President Obama's meetings this week on Capitol Hill, Sens. Sanders and Tom Harkin spoke out strongly against changes in calculating cost-of-living increases for Social Security. "It would make major cuts in Social Security benefits ... and also very significant cuts for disabled veterans," Sanders said in a telephone interview afterward with The Associated Press. "I do not believe that the American people want to balance the budget on the backs of disabled veterans or widows who lost their husbands in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."

The Week in Review:   The Senate Budget Committee on Thursday approved a plan that would reduce the deficit by $1.85 trillion over 10 years through a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The panel added amendments by Sen. Bernie Sanders to end offshore tax havens and raise the minimum wage. In the House, meanwhile, a budget was proposed that would make drastic spending cuts without asking the wealthy and profitable corporations to contribute to deficit reduction. “Disastrous” and “insane” were two words Sanders used to describe what House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan proposed. Earlier in the week, Sanders chaired a Wednesday hearing on a claims backlog at the VA. And on Tuesday he introduced a constitutional amendment that would undo Citizens United, the notorious Supreme Court ruling that voided campaign finance regulations.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Tax Dodgers: The Senate Budget Committee on Thursday approved an amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders to go after tax-dodging corporations. Republicans on the committee voted unanimously against closing loopholes that enable profitable corporations to pay nothing in taxes, according to The Washington Post online.   Minimum Wage: Also on a party-line vote, the committee adopted Sanders’ amendment supporting an increase in the minimum wage. He cited the low-wages of Wal-Mart employees and the wealth of Wal-Mart owners, the Walton family. Sen. Michael Enzi criticized the amendment, saying he didn’t think any senator should “vote for this who isn’t paying their interns minimum wage,” Congressional Quarterly reported.   Social Security Cuts: House and Senate leaders are edging toward supporting Social Security cuts as part of a “grand bargain” Obama wants Sen. Sanders has instead called on the White House and Dem leaders to accept a long-term deal that includes increased revenues and cuts spending judiciously without targeting entitlement benefits, according to a Washington Post blog.   Sanders Calls Ryan Budget ‘Insane’: Sen. Sanders went on the offensive against Rep. Paul Ryan’s new budget plan Thursday, calling it, “insane” and “disastrous,” MSNBC reported online.  “It is insane to simply talk about ‘cut, cut, cut’ when you’ve got the wealthiest people and large corporations doing phenomenally well and paying lower effective tax rates than they should,” the Vermont Independent senator said to The Cycle hosts Thursday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Social Security Cuts Draw Critics: A growing number of Democrats have declared their opposition to President Obama’s offer to apply a less-generous measure of inflation to Social Security, resulting in smaller annual cost-of-living increases. “I don't want to break the bad news to you, but the president is not the only elected official in the United States," said Sen. Bernard Sanders, a member of the Budget Committee, who pressed Murray to avoid any cuts to social programs in her spending plan. "Some of us believe very strongly that it would be absolutely wrong to cut Social Security benefits,” he told The Washington Post.   Budget Plan: “The Ryan budget and what the Republicans want to do is deficit reduction by doing away with Medicare as we know it and converting that into a voucher system,” Sen. Sanders said during an interview on C-Span’s Washington Journal. “We are looking at record- breaking profits for corporations, yet their tax rate is the lowest since 1972.”   VA Backlog: Members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee demanded the VA share its internal performance data with Congress to give lawmakers a fuller picture of what is happening at the beleaguered agency. But responses from Allison Hickey, the VA’s undersecretary for benefits, were so vague it was unclear whether the information will be turned over. “When men and women put their lives on the line defending this country, they must be treated with respect and dignity when they return, not with red tape and bureaucracy, not, in some cases, with years of delay,” Sen. Sanders said in Veterans Today and PJ Media reports.   Citizens United: Sen. Sanders and Rep. Ted Deutch introduced a constitutional amendment on Tuesday aimed at reversing the Supreme Court's ruling on Citizens United. Sanders has been a longtime advocate of reversing the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling which allowed unrestricted spending in federal campaigns, The Huffington Post and Democracy Now reported.

VA Claims Backlog: http://youtu.be/aU0Kbgc7ztU  The Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs held a hearing Wednesday on a claims backlog at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chairman, said 70 percent of 895,000 current claims have been pending for more than 125 days. “The significant backlog in processing claims is why the first hearing the committee is holding under my leadership is addressing this issue,” he said.  “It is my view, and I believe the view of every member of this committee, that when men and women put their lives on the line defending this country, they must be treated with respect and dignity when they return. Not with red tape and bureaucracy, not with, in some cases, years of delay.”  To the VA’s credit, Sanders said, more than 1 million claims were processed in each of the past three years, more than ever before. He welcomed the “very ambitious goal” set by VA Secretary Eric Shinseki of eliminating the backlog by 2015.

Happening now: Chairman Sanders is holding a hearing of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs to address the unacceptable backlog of veterans’ disability claims. Watch live here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/  Currently there are nearly 900,000 veterans waiting for their disability claims to be processed. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, 70 percent of claims have been pending longer than the department’s goal of 125 days.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  President Meets Senators" President Obama made a rare visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday and told Senate Democrats behind closed doors that he was open to cutting Social Security benefits as part of a deficit-reduction deal with congressional Republicans. “He is more inclined to cut benefits, which I strongly disagree with," Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Wall Street Journal and United Press International after leaving the meeting with the president. “I’m going to fight as hard as I can to make the point that Social Security has not contributed on nickel to the deficit,” Sanders said Wednesday morning on National Public Radio’s “Morning Edition.”   Obama Challenged on Social Security: Sens. Sanders and Tom Harkin questioned Obama’s proposal to cut Social Security benefits, The Hill, National Journal and Congressional Quarterly reported. In an interview afterward with Reuters, Sanders said it would be better to bring more revenue into the system. "There are ways to address these problems without cutting benefits," he said.  “Some of us suggested doing what he [Obama] proposed in 2008, which is to lift the cap on taxable income,” Sanders said. Harkin told Politico that Obama's response to his and Sanders’ concerns was “basically things are open for negotiation."   Sanders Made Case for Veterans: Beyond Social Security, Sanders said he specifically highlighted to the president what Chained CPI would do to veterans, The Nation reported. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new formula would cost a veteran who began receiving benefits at 30 $1,425 at age 45 and $3,231 at age 65. “I just don’t think that this president should develop a legacy to be the guy who cuts back on benefits for people who lost their arms and legs in Iraq and Afghanistan, or widows who lost their husbands,” said Sanders.   Sign Bernie’s Petition: “I am prepared to work with other progressives to do everything we can to make sure that the budget is not balanced on a collapsing middle class and on 46 million people who are living poverty and on many elderly people who are barely keeping their heads above water economically,” Sen. Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC. “We now have a new petition up on our Web site, sanders.senate.gov,” Sanders added. The petition to President Obama, Senate Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner attracted more than 6,500 signatures overnight.

A federal budget that reduces the deficit by cutting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and disabled veterans, raising the Medicare eligibility age and lowering tax rates for the most profitable corporations in this country is not a grand bargain. It is a bad bargain.  We oppose the chained-CPI, a new way to measure inflation and consumer prices designed to cut benefits for Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and their survivors.  We demand a budget that puts millions of Americans back to work in decent paying jobs.  We demand a budget that makes sure that the wealthiest Americans and most profitable corporations pay their fair share.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Budget Cuts: Sen. Bernie Sanders said $85 billion in across-the-board federal budget cuts that began to take effect on March 1 are hurting Vermonters. He was joined at a news conference at his Burlington office on Monday by Steve Geller, executive director Southeastern Vermont Community Action, and Marianne Miller, Head Start director at Central Vermont Community Action Council. Geller says as many as 4,400 families could be affected by cuts in rental assistance, crisis fuel aid and other emergency assistance programs that help keep families in their homes. Miller says as many as 170 children out of 1,500 enrolled in Head Start in Vermont may be affected, The Associated Press reported.  Budget Committee: Congress this week will take the first steps toward a more structured and orderly budget process. Sen. Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, has tried to ensure that the Democrats’ budget does not include an adjustment to the inflation rate that would calculate it in a way that would decrease federal benefits. Sanders told The New York Times he was confident the inflation rate calculation would be untouched as part of the budget process, but he still was not prepared to sign on to Chairman Patty Murray’s plan until he sees the final document. “We’ve had long talks; we’ll see what happens,” he said.   Sanders to Obama: Don’t Cut Social Security: President Obama has spent the past week urging Republicans to reopen talks to reach a broad deficit-reduction deal, a so-called grand bargain, outside the normal budget-writing process. Sen. Sanders said he has told the president of his opposition to changing how inflation is calculated to cut benefits. “We're talking about real money here and a very significant benefit cut," Sanders said. "I absolutely disagree and will do everything I can to defeat any such proposal,” The Wall Street Journal reported.   Blocking a Bad Bargain: A filibuster may be part of a strategy to resist Obama’s proposed cuts to Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, according to The Washington Post. But “that’s a one-day tactic,” Sanders said. He spoke about working with a bloc of like-minded senators and reaching out to the grass roots. “This is about rallying the American people and winning.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C00A6977-F48A-4687-B1EF-0249CBC6764D
Chained CPI: An Economic, moral disaster - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): http://thehill.com/special-reports/state-of-the-union-february-2013/282395-chained-cpi-an-economic-moral-disaster#ixzz2N5F0I5Ko
End Offshore Tax Havens:  The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that its own analysis of 60 big U.S. companies found that they parked $166 billion offshore last year. A separate Bloomberg analysis published Friday said the largest U.S.-based companies expanded their untaxed offshore stockpiles by $183 billion, a 14.4 percent jump in the past year. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, has called for closing those tax loopholes to help bring down deficits. “At a time when we have a $16.6 trillion national debt; at a time when roughly one-quarter of the largest corporations in America are paying no federal income taxes; and at a time when corporate profits are at an all-time high, it is past time for corporate America to contribute significantly to deficit reduction,” he said.  Do you believe Congress should or should not close loopholes allowing corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid U.S. taxes by shifting income overseas?

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget Impact on Vermont: At a news conference Monday at his Burlington office, Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to discuss how federal spending cuts are impacting Vermonters. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders said last week that he was working on a budget which would create jobs, lower the deficit and protect working families and the most vulnerable people, The Associated Press reported.   Budget Committee: Senate and House committees will propose budget resolutions this week that set tax and spending targets for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Sen. Patty Murray will need support from every Democrat on her panel, and they span the ideological spectrum from Sanders, an independent who describes himself as a Democratic socialist, to Sen. Mark Warner, who would prefer a budget that could draw bipartisan support, The Wall Street Journal reported. Sanders “plays a vital role,” according to The Hill.   Bad Bargain: President Obama may be thinking about a "grand bargain" to address spending and the federal deficit, but the talk of any deal with congressional Republicans has liberals worried the White House may go along with raising the retirement age of Medicare and adopting an inflation calculation, known as chained CPI, for Social Security. Sanders said flatly that the president was "dead wrong" to consider chained CPI. "The veterans community does not agree with the president; the senior community does not agree with the president; women's communities don't agree with the president. He's way out of touch on this issue, and I hope he rethinks this," Sanders said in Politico.   Chairman Sanders: Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Sanders has won veterans' support by consistently focusing on the issues most important to them. Among Sanders' latest priorities is a backlog of 900,000 disability claims at the Veterans Affairs Department that keeps veterans waiting months or years for benefits. He will hold a hearing on the issue March 13, USA Today reported online.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=F9F803B8-98D6-48B7-AEC2-CCBCFC441C10

Chained CPI: An economic, moral disaster - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): http://thehill.com/special-reports/state-of-the-union-february-2013/282395-chained-cpi-an-economic-moral-disaster#ixzz2N5F0I5Ko
Chained CPI: An economic, moral disaster - Sen. Bernie Sanders:   How many candidates for Congress last year won on the following platform?  1. That Social Security cost-of-living adjustments are too generous. Social Security should be cut over the next two decades by more than $1,000 a year for 85-year-old widows living on $1,200 a month.   2. That benefits earned by disabled veterans as a result of losing their arms, legs or eyesight in Iraq and Afghanistan are too generous. Disabled veterans’ benefits should be cut over the next 15 years by more than $1,400 a year.  3. That working families and the middle class don’t pay enough in taxes. We need to enact an across-the-board tax increase that disproportionately hurts workers making between $30,000 and $40,000 a year.  Answer: None. And yet all of these things will happen if Congress changes the way inflation is calculated by switching to a consumer price index (CPI) designed to lower cost-of-living adjustments.

In your view, as Congress and the president discuss steps to reduce the budget deficit, should they focus only on spending cuts, only on tax increases or should they do a combination of both?
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sanders Has ‘Made a Difference’ for Veterans: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the new Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs chairman, has won veterans' support by focusing on issues important to them from health problems caused by Agent Orange and Gulf War illness to disabled veterans' fears that their benefits will be cut. Among Sanders' latest priorities is a backlog of 900,000 disability claims at the Veterans Affairs Department. He will hold a hearing on the issue on March 13. "He's stepped up and made a difference in a lot of veterans' lives," John Miner, past president of the Vietnam Veterans of America in Vermont told Gannett News Service.   A Grand Bargain or a Bad Bargain?: Sen. Sanders said he would oppose any budget deal that cuts Social Security and Medicare, “If we’re talking about some kind of so-called grand bargain which would cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and not ask one out of four large corporations who pay zero in taxes today to start paying, that`s not a grand bargain that I think the American people would support,” Sanders told Thomas Roberts on MSNBC.   Obama Wants to Cut Security: President Obama is reached out to Republicans in a charm offensive capped by a dinner Wednesday night with a dozen Republican senators. Obama underscored his interest in reaching a deficit-reduction deal by reiterating a willingness to accept entitlement benefit cuts. “The left was unnerved.by Wednesday night’s dinner and the new drive on deficit-reduction,” according to The Hill. The day of the dinner, the article added, Sen. Sanders held a press conference warning the president not to cut entitlement benefits.

The Week in Review:   A “grand bargain” on budget cuts that President Obama is negotiating with congressional Republicans would be a “bad bargain” for seniors, veterans and others whose benefits would be cut, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Friday. Legislation to implement a better Obama idea to strengthen Social Security was introduced in the Senate on Thursday by Sanders and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The U.S. economy added jobs in February, but the Labor Department reported on Friday that real unemployment remained at 14.3 percent. The failure of Congress to come up with an alternative to $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that began to kick in this month could cost 750,000 jobs, economists say.  One way to create jobs would be to invest in new energy systems to replace the fossil-fuel polluters that cause global warming. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped dramatically in 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported on Wednesday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Wants to Cut Social Security: Sen. Sanders and others in Congress are ratcheting up pressure on President Barack Obama to back away from a proposal to cut Social Security benefits. They’re concerned Obama may strike a deficit-reduction deal with Republicans that would reduce Social Security benefits by adopting a less generous way of adjusting benefits for inflation, The Hill reported.   Obama’s ‘Horrendous Idea’: “It’s a horrendous idea. It is totally absurd because for a start, Social Security has not contributed one penny to the deficit … But it`s not just seniors on Social Security. If you can believe it, this chained CPI will make devastating cuts for disabled veterans. The men and women who lost arms and legs in Iraq and Afghanistan, the widows of people who were killed in Iraq -- it will mean significant cuts for them,” Sanders told Ed Schultz on MSNBC.   Grand Bargain: President Obama dined Wednesday with 12 Republican senators, lunched Thursday at the White House with House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and will visit Senate and House Republican caucuses on Capitol Hill next week to revive hopes for his “grand bargain” on a budget. Sen. Sanders ripped the president for wanting to cut Social Security and veterans’ benefits by adopting a stingier gauge of inflation. “The president historically has not been a strong negotiator,” he told Congressional Quarterly. “The fear is he is going to get a deal that will probably not be strong enough on revenue. That does worry some of us.”   Strengthen Social Security: Sen. Sanders introduced legislation Thursday to strengthen Social Security. The bill would apply the payroll tax to all income over $250,000 a year, The Hill and KCSB-FM in Santa Barbara, Calif. reported. “You do that, it hits the top 1 1/2 percent. Social Security is strong for the next 50 years,” Sanders said on MSNBC.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=E25B5440-BC71-4320-9569-59C74C011D56

CIA:  The Senate on Thursday confirmed John Brennan as CIA director. Sen. Bernie Sanders was among those voting no. The final vote was 63 to 34 to confirm the nomination of the former intelligence officer who held posts under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. During Brennan’s confirmation process, questions were raised about the use of drone aircraft and so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. “While we must aggressively pursue international terrorists and all of those who would do us harm, we must do it in a way that protects the Constitution and the civil liberties which make us proud to be Americans,” Sanders said. “With regard to the use of drones and other methods employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, I am not convinced that Mr. Brennan is adequately sensitive to the important balancing act required to make protecting our civil liberties an integral part of ensuring our national security.”  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=17A0F22D-BC56-453C-BE71-290CE220095B
Strengthen Social Security:  Legislation to strengthen Social Security by making the wealthiest Americans pay the same payroll tax that nearly everyone else already pays was introduced Thursday by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid cosponsored the Senate bill. Rep. Peter DeFazio introduced the companion measure in the House. He joined Sanders at a news conference in the Capitol to discuss their bill to bolster Social Security without raising the retirement age or lowering benefits.  “Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation's history. Through good times and bad, Social Security has paid out every benefit owed to every eligible American,” Sanders said. “The most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to eliminate the cap on the payroll tax on income above $250,000 so millionaires and billionaires pay the same share as everyone else.”  Reid said, “I want to thank Sen. Sanders for his outstanding leadership in support of Social Security and the millions of Americans who rely on the program.  His legislation should make people think twice before assuming that the only way to strengthen Social Security is to take away benefits that seniors have earned, or raise taxes on the middle class.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9620E6C6-723F-4D76-8CC6-42888492829C
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Credit Scores: Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to give consumers more access to their credit reports and more protection from mistakes. A recent federal study found one in every four credit reports has an error that can affect consumers' eligibility for loans. Sanders' bill would make sure consumers get to see the same information banks see, according to WCAX-TV and Consumers Union.   Budget: With $85 billion in sequestration cuts slowly setting in, Sen. Sanders is focusing on crafting a federal budget that closes tax loopholes for the wealthy and corporations and protects low- and middle-income Americans. He is working with his Democratic colleagues on the Senate Budget Committee on a 10-year budget plan which should hit the Senate floor later this month, the Brattleboro Reformer reported on Thursday.   Drone Filibuster: Sen. Rand Paul spoke for nearly 13 hours Wednesday in an attempt to block confirmation of John Brennan as President Obama's CIA director as a protest of the administration's policy of targeted killings using drones. It was the first talking filibuster since 2010, when Sen. Sanders held the floor for more than eight hours in opposition to Obama’s plan to extend Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, Reuters reported.   China Postpones Carbon Tax: China will wait until after this year to introduce a tax on carbon, deferring to concern that economic growth might suffer. The nation eventually expects to introduce a levy of 80 cents to $1.61 per ton of carbon. In the U.S., Sens. Sanders and Boxer unveiled a bill last month which would levy a tax of $20 per ton of carbon, Bloomberg and Mother Nature Network reported.

Global Warming:   The amount of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped dramatically in 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported on Wednesday. Scientists say the rise in CO2 reflects increased burning of fossil fuels.  Last year saw the second greatest jump in carbon emissions since record-keeping began in 1959. “As carbon concentrations continue to rise and we see more and more extreme weather and other effects of global warming, it is clear Congress has got to get its act together and pass strong legislation. That is why Sen. Boxer and I introduced the Climate Protection Act, bold legislation to cut emissions by a significant amount and invest in energy efficiency and sustainable energy,” Sanders said. “I fear very much that history will look back at this period and ask, ‘How could it be that the United States did not address this planetary crisis when it had the chance?’”  http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=143B4DFE-2160-4128-9792-B1FF84AA5EF4
Credit Scores:   Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday introduced legislation that would provide consumers free access to error-riddled credit scores that banks use to decide who gets loans and how much interest to charge.  Rep. Steve Cohen introduced a companion bill in the House to protect consumers by giving them access to the same credit information that banks see when considering loan applications. Their legislation was introduced during National Consumer Credit Week.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=E935254B-6114-4B13-9A57-59D58CC7D917
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Medicare Cuts: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has floated the idea of reneging on his promise that people 55 and older would be exempt from his plan to replace Medicare with private health insurance vouchers. “What the Republicans believe in is doing away with the entire social safety net created during the 30’s by FDR … That’s their long-term goal. To bring us back to the 1920’s when a handful of corporations and wealthy people controlled the economic and political life of the nation,” Sen. Bernie Sanders warned Tuesday on The Ed Schultz Show.   Global Warming: Former Secretary of State George Schultz is a leading proponent of a carbon tax. “This puts Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state on the page as uber-liberal Sens. Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Sanders introduced legislation to implement a carbon tax that Boxer, chairman of the Senate environmental committee, co-sponsored.   Tar Sands Oil: More than two dozen Vermont towns passed nonbinding resolutions that urge a more thorough review of the risks, and, in some cases, a phase-out of fuel purchases from vendors that sell tar-sand oil. Ripton, the home of 350.org founder and notable tar-sands opponent Bill McKibben, was among them. The resolution passed unanimously there. Voters in Burlington disapprovd tar-sand oil by a 2-1 margin, the Burlington Free Press reported.   Dow Hits Record: In an economy struggling to recover, the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday surged past the high it last reached more than five years ago before the financial crisis hit with full force, The New York Times reported.

A New Attack on Medicare:  First it was $85 billion in across-the-board budget cuts. Now, in the name of deficit reduction, some of the fringe, far-right Republicans who run the House may abandon their own campaign pledge and cut Medicare benefits for people 55 and older. Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to lower deficits. He has offered ways to do it by stopping profitable corporations from stashing income in offshore tax havens. But instead of adding revenue, Republicans want to eliminate the social safety net. “It’s part of their long-term plan to decimate programs that benefit working families,” Sanders told Ed Schultz on Tuesday.  Listen to the The Ed Schultz Show interview here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/media/listen/?m=111af738-e681-4a7a-bd62-c4ce1e7581c8
The Week in Review:   “What the president is proposing is going to hurt a lot of people,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday after the White House confirmed that President Obama’s budget will include cuts in Social Security. He called it a “bitter disappointment” that the budget will propose changing how annual cost-of-living adjustments are calculated in a way designed to lower benefits. As the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Sanders added that the proposal also would cut benefits for disabled veterans and their survivors. Glaciers in the Andes that took 1,600 years or more to form have melted in just 25 years, scientists reported Thursday.

Do you believe Congress should or should not close loopholes allowing corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid U.S. taxes by shifting income overseas?
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget: With $85 billion in sequestration cuts setting in and funding for all government programs running out on March 27, Sen. Bernie Sanders is focusing on crafting a federal budget that protects low- and middle-income Americans, the Bennington Banner reported. Sanders said the wealthy and profitable corporations must help close the budget deficit at a time when corporate profits at an all-time high while corporate income tax revenue as a share of the overall economy is near a record low, The Associated Press reported. He told the Burlington Free Press that he expects Congress will avoid a government shutdown at the end of March.  Global Warming: Sen. Sanders partnered with Sen. Barbara Boxer on a bill that would put a fee on carbon emissions as a tool to try to force changes in the energy marketplace and affect global warming trends. The fee would be levied on the largest emitters of carbon and raise $1.2 trillion over 10 years that Sanders said would be used for weatherization, research and development for breakthroughs in energy and worker training, the Burlington Free Press reported.   Gay Marriage: Sens. Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday in a case that challenges the constitutionality of the federal marriage law. Leahy, who voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, has since changed his mind and is now one of the sponsors of a bill which would repeal the federal law that discriminates against same-sex married couples, the Burlington Free Press reported.   Wind Power: “Regarding the proposed three-year wind moratorium bill, in a recent press conference Sen. Sanders expressed my exact opinions on the issue, stating the need for a transition to renewable energy in the face of climate change,” Neil Brandt wrote in a letter to the editor of the Burlington Free Press.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Tar Sands Pipeline: A State Department report released late Friday on a new oil pipeline from Canada to Texas infuriated environmentalists who have made the project a litmus test for whether President Obama is serious about tackling climate change. “The president cannot tell us that he is concerned about global warming and approve the Keystone XL project,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said in The Hill.   Transaction Tax: Sen. Tom Harkin announced legislation last week to impose a tax on Wall Street trading.  Sen. Sanders is a co-sponsor of the proposal that would generate $352 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. It would not cover the initial issuance of any stocks or bonds, The Nation reported.   Profits Soar, Jobs Lag: With millions still out of work, companies face little pressure to raise salaries while productivity gains allow them to increase sales without adding workers. The result has been a golden age for corporate profits, especially among multinational giants that also benefit from faster growth in emerging economies, according to The New York Times.   Obama Wants to Cut Social Security: President Obama told lawmakers on Saturday that he remains willing to reform entitlement programs, White House economist Gene Sperling said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union, Reuters reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Sequestration: President Obama and congressional leaders failed Friday to reach agreement on how to avoid the first round of sequestration cuts that will total $85 billion by Sept. 30. Interviewed Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program, Sen. Bernie Sanders called the cuts “a real tragedy” that will hurt education, environmental protection and other important programs. Republicans in Congress, Sanders added, “are absolutely adamant that they will not ask the wealthy and large corporations to pay a nickel more in taxes and the only way they want to do deficit reduction is by cutting, cutting, cutting.”  Keystone Pipeline: The State Department issued a revised environmental impact statement for the 1,700-mile pipeline on Friday that makes no recommendation about whether the project should be built but presents no conclusive environmental reason it should not be, The New York Times reported.   National Guard: Uncertainty about how sequestration cuts could affect the Vermont National Guard hung over the swearing-in Friday of Maj. Gen. Steven Cray as adjutant general. “You are assuming office on a very unusual day,” Sen. Sanders told Cray. “You face not a military conflict but a financial conflict.” Sanders vowed to do all he could to lessen the blow to the Guard, the Burlington Free Press reported.  Budget Political Ploy: The Senate this week defeated a Republican proposal to let the president decide what programs to cut. On Vermont Public Television’s “Vermont This Week,”, Sen. Sanders called it a “political ploy that would say, ‘Okay Mr. President, we’re going to give you the flexibility, we’re going to let you decide whether you’re cutting back on the National Guard, whether you’re cutting back on nutrition, whether you’re cutting back on Head Start, whether you’re cutting back on education so the people are not going to blame us. They’re going to blame you.’ It was really a very superficial political ploy.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=52178189-d483-45a0-9f88-36779c3071ba
Week in Review:  President Obama and congressional leaders met Friday at the White House without agreeing on an alternative to $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts. Sen. Bernie Sanders called it “a real tragedy” and said the cuts could “contract the economy in the midst of a terrible recession” and could cost the country 700,000 jobs.  Over Sanders’ objection, a new treasury secretary was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday. The House on Thursday sent to the White House a Senate-passed bill reauthorizing a landmark 1994 bill that helps victims of domestic violence. And Sanders on Friday was among 212 members of Congress who urged the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. The State Department late Friday cleared the way for President Obama to approve the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline. He should reject the project, Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sequester: The Senate on Thursday defeated dueling bills to avert deep, automatic spending cuts that begin taking effect later today. A White House meeting with congressional leaders on Friday was unlikely to come up with an alternative to chopping $85 billion in federal spending by Sept. 30. The sequester, as the cuts are called, was set in motion by a 2011 budget deal that Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against. Interviewed Thursday night on Vermont Public Television, Sanders said the cuts will “contract the economy in the midst of a terrible recession” and may eliminate 700,000 jobs nationwide.  Wall Street Tax: Democrats in the House and Senate, seizing on concerns over budget deficits, are renewing their push for a tax on financial transactions. Sen. Sanders cosponsored a bill introduced Thursday by Sen. Tom Harkin, CQ-Roll Call reported. The legislation is expected to run into opposition from the financial industry and the Obama administration.  Violence Against Women: The Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization was approved by the House on Thursday by a vote of 286 to 136, The New York Times reported. A total of 87 Republicans voted in favor of the Senate bill after several Republicans broke with their leadership to defeat a weaker House version.   Gay Marriage: The Obama administration told the Supreme Court on Thursday that California’s ban on same-sex marriage violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection, a position that could also cast doubt on prohibitions in other states. The administration did not endorse a constitutional right to marry that would apply nationwide, The Washington Post reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget Brinksmanship: President Obama invited congressional leaders to the White House tomorrow to try to find an alternative to $85 billion in across-the-board spending reductions due to take effect starting Friday. Sen. Bernie Sanders hoped the effort succeeds. “There is nobody who believes sequestration makes a lot of sense,” Sanders told Chris Jansing on MSNBC.   Undoing the New Deal: Some in Congress see a rare opportunity to whittle down Pentagon spending but say the military cuts are not enough to justify damage to other programs. ''While the Democrats may be winning the political battle, Republicans are winning the ideological war,'' Sen. Sanders told The New York Times. ''The goal of the right wing is to essentially undo the Roosevelt era, the New Deal, substantially cut back on government, and in a sense, they are achieving that. This is a huge step.''   Sanders Voted No on Sequester: With its meat-cleaver hacks, the sequester was intentionally designed to force compromise.  In the Senate, six Democrats plus Sanders voted no when the sequester mechanism was put in place in 2011. House Democrats split down the middle on the deal 95-95, with most progressives voting against it, according to Salon.   Bankers Dodge Taxes: In a statement on the Senate floor explaining why he would vote against Lew, Sen. Sanders accused Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs of taking taxpayer bailouts and then avoiding U.S. taxes, The Huffington Post reported. “When it comes to paying their taxes, oh, suddenly they love the Cayman Islands,” Sanders said of Wall Street banks. “So my suggestion is, the next time these crooks destroy their banks and they need to be bailed out, let them go to the government of the Cayman Islands to get their bailout.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=362DAAD3-F4C7-40E1-88E7-6BD8E23C55F8

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  ‘Dumb’ Budget Cuts: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday called $85 billion in across-the-board spending reductions due to take effect starting Friday “a dumb way to do cuts.” On The Ed Schultz Show, Sanders said more revenue is needed to lower deficits. He noted that total revenue today amounts to about 16 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. That’s down from more than 20 percent the last time the federal budget was balanced when Bill Clinton was president.  Carbon Tax: Sen. Sanders on Tuesday hit back at a National Association of Manufacturers report claiming that a tax on carbon emissions to fight global warming would cut factory output and hurt the U.S. economy. The cost of not responding to climate change would escalate costs to taxpayers, homeowners and businesses as natural disasters become more frequent, Sanders countered. Legislation that Sanders introduced with Sen. Barbara Boxer calls for a $75 billion in the coming decade to help manufacturers invest in energy efficiency and make them more competitive. It also would invest $10 billion over 10 years for job-training programs for workers in new energy technologies, Reuters reported.   VA Backlog: Sen. Sanders told an American Legion conference in Washington on Tuesday that an “overwhelmed, broken claims system” at the Department of Veterans Affairs is not prepared for the arrival of new veterans as combat troops return home from Afghanistan, Stars and Stripes reported. He pledged “aggressive” oversight by his Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs to push for a faster solution, Navy Times reported. A hearing is planned for next month, The Examiner reported.   Treasury Secretary: The Senate Finance Committee advanced Jack Lew’s nomination as Treasury Secretary for a confirmation vote on the Senate floor, CQ-Roll Call reported. Five Republicans on the panel voted against Lew, joining fellow Republican Jeff Sessions and Sen. Sanders in opposition to Obama’s nominee.

The Cost of Climate Change:   The Brookings Institution said Tuesday that a carbon tax could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lessen federal budget shortfalls. The National Association of Manufacturers, meanwhile, released a study that found a carbon tax would hurt the economy. Sen. Bernie Sanders disputed the manufacturers’ lobby. He pointed to ways his legislation on climate change would help business, create jobs and save billions of dollars spent on disaster relief.  “The price that America cannot afford to pay is the price of doing nothing to reverse global warming,” he said. Sanders recently introduced climate change legislation that is co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Budget Battle: Already looking past the current budget impasse, congressional leaders are quietly considering a deal to avert a government shutdown next month. Attention is beginning to shift from Friday, when broad cuts known as the sequester kick in, to the next budget deadline at the end of March when Congress must pass a so-called continuing resolution to keep funding government operations.   Tax Havens: Sen. Bernie Sanders recently introduced legislation that would eliminate companies’ ability to defer taxes indefinitely. What would happen if that were to pass is companies would actually pay taxes on the money they earned when they earn it and not be able to defer it into the future, Matt Drange of the Center for Investigative Reporting said in an interview for the American Public Media radio program Marketplace.     Global Warming: Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer introduced legislation that would place a fee on coal, oil and natural gas at the first point of sale and then rebate a substantial part of the revenue to the public as monthly "dividends," Mark Reynolds, executive director of Citizens Climate Lobby, wrote in an op-ed for the Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo.  Treasury Secretary: The Senate Finance Committee scheduled a vote for Tuesday on Jacob Lew’s nomination to succeed Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary. So far, only two senators announced their opposition to the nomination. Sen. Sanders fears Lew is too closely associated with Wall Street. Sen. Jeff Sessions accuses Lew of misleading the Senate in his presentation of Obama’s budget.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C51AD482-FCD3-46DE-AC6F-6BF420AB896C
Must Read: Will Half a Billion Bucks Buy a New Recession? - Robert L. Borosage:   The "sequester" -- mindless, across-the-board spending cuts designed purposefully to be abhorrent to both political parties -- now seems likely to go into effect on March 1. If not reversed, we will see the degrading of all government services from food inspection to airport controls, as mass furloughs -- 20-30 day forced absences without pay -- shudder agencies.  The sequester cuts added to spending cuts and tax increases already scheduled will slow growth and cost jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office and most economic analysis. Government austerity has already contributed to the worst recovery in post-World War II history. In Europe, austerity has driven the economies back into recession, with the countries enforcing the harshest cuts suffering the most.  Why would the U.S. repeat this folly, despite warnings from the IMF and Federal Reserve officials? Every calamity has many authors -- Obama's premature turn to deficit reduction in 2009, the Tea Party zealots, a hapless and clueless Republican congressional leadership and more.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Banks Bailed Out by Taxpayers Dodge Taxes: On Moyers & Company on PBS this weekend, economist Richard Wolff says he learned a few days ago – “and I got it actually from senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont – that during the very years 2009, '10, '11, when the federal government was basically bailing out the biggest banks in the United States, they were busily establishing or operating subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, in the Caribbean, in order to evade taxes.”  Climate Change: Senate environment committee Chairman Barbara Boxer is pushing climate change legislation with Sen. Sanders. “She declines to admit the obvious: That the measure is dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled House and even faces grim prospects of seeing the light of day on the Democratic-controlled Senate floor. She insists the legislation serves a purpose nonetheless. ‘You want to have a bill out there that people can rally around,’” Boxer told National Journal.   Global Warming: Legislation by Sens. Sanders and Boxer amounts to “an environmentalist’s wish list,” Alex Seitz-Wald wrote for Salon. Their proposal would put a price on carbon, regulate fracking, invest in green energy technology “and thus is probably little more than a sacrificial lamb so that Obama can move on to phase two: executive action.” Farron Cousins blogged for Ring of Fire about a boast by the oil industry’s top lobbyist that the bill is doomed. “The American Petroleum Institute wields a lot of power in Washington, and if Jack Gerard says that a bill won’t see the light of day, he means it.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=fb551221-970d-4023-9573-c30d81479a93
The Week in Review:   Across-the-board spending cuts totaling $85 billion are set to kick in on March 1 unless Congress and the White House reach agreement on an alternative. Sen. Bernie Sanders has called for profitable corporations to pay their fair share to help balance the budget. The American public continues to support a mix of tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit, according to a new poll released Thursday by USA Today. What do you think? In other news, China may tax polluters for emissions that cause global warming, the state-owned Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.  The development in Beijing drew comparisons to a new proposal for a carbon tax in the United States advocated by Sanders and Senate environment committee Chairman Barbara Boxer. Sanders and Boxer and others on the committee on Wednesday asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission why it hasn’t implemented safety measures at Vermont Yankee and other U.S. power plants with designs similar to a Japanese reactor that melted down two years ago.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Health Care: Vermont is on track to become the first state to implement a single-payer health insurance system in 2017. “If we do it and do it well, other states will get in line and follow us,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Vermont Life. “It will not only be enormously important to this state, it will be a model.” Sanders has been advocating a single-payer system since he was mayor of Burlington in the 1980’s, the magazine said.   Tax Havens: Pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly and Pfizer have fought to make it illegal for the American people to buy cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and Europe, but they shift drug patents and profits to the Netherlands and other offshore tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes,” Sen. Sanders wrote in an op-ed published by the Bennington Banner. The London-based global bank Barclays is closing a controversial tax-avoidance unit, The International reported in an article that cited Sanders’ bill to close loopholes corporations use to evade U.S. taxes.   Carbon Tax: China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, may soon get its very own tax on carbon emissions. Although U.S. carbon emissions are falling at the moment, many analysts think we’ll ultimately need a price on carbon to ensure the trend continues. Last week, Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sanders unveiled a bill that would impose a carbon tax in the United States starting at $20 per ton, The Washington Post reported online.   Nuclear Safety: Sen. Sanders signed on with 11 other senators calling on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enact safety upgrades recommended by its own staff. The safety recommendations were made following an analysis on how to prevent radiation incidents similar to what happened in Fukushima, Japan following the 2011 tsunami, Environment & Energy Daily reported.

Single Payer in Vermont:  Vermont is leading the nation in development of a health care system that would provide better care for more people at less cost. “If Vermont can pass a strong single-payer system and show it works well, it will not only be enormously important to this state, it will be a model,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told Vermont Life. “If we do it and do it well, other states will get in line and follow us … and we will have a national system.” The new magazine article said Sanders has been a leading advocate for a single-payer system since his days at mayor of Burlington in the 1980s.

Nuclear Power Safety:  It’s been almost two years since an earthquake and tsunami caused a meltdown at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan. It’s been more than two months since the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff recommended safety measures to protect 31 similarly-designed reactors in the United States, including one at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant along the Connecticut River at Vernon, Vt.  The industry-friendly commission dragged its feet on earlier safety proposals and has not acted on the most recent staff recommendation. On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders asked why not. He was among a dozen members of the Senate committee that oversees the federal nuclear safety agency to sign a letter from Chairman Barbara Boxer. “The tens of millions of Americans who live near the affected reactors located in 15 states should not face additional delays,” the letter said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Tax Evaders: In the worst recession since the 1930s, the largest financial institutions in the United States took a $700 billion taxpayer bailout and $16 trillion more from the Federal Reserve. Just two years later, at a time of mounting deficits largely created by the recession that Wall Street caused, the major financial institutions did everything they could to avoid paying American taxes by establishing shell corporations in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, Sen. Sanders wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by the Rutland Herald.   Tax Havens: One out of four profitable corporations pays nothing in taxes. Government revenue as a percentage of GDP is lower than at any time in history. Sen. Sanders and Jan Schakowsky have an answer. They introduced a bill that would raise $590 billion over the next decade and stop giving tax breaks to corporations for shipping jobs overseas, according to the San Diego Free Press.   Chinese to Tax Carbon Emissions: China’s Ministry of Finance announced that the country will levy a tax on carbon emissions, the Xinhua news service reported. Policy experts in the United States and Europe have long argued that a carbon tax is the most effective way to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, but implementing one in most large industrialized countries has always seemed politically infeasible. In the U.S., Sens. Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders have proposed a carbon tax of $20 a ton, the digital economics news service Quartz noted.   Campaign Funding: The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a challenge to federal campaign contribution limits to political candidates. “The laborious route of a constitutional amendment stating plainly that corporations are not people and that money is not speech is really the only avenue left in reforming what the Court has done … The simplest one with the straightest line would seem to be the one that Bernie Sanders has been pushing,” Charles Pierce blogged for Esquire.

Environmental Scorecard:  The League of Conservation Voters on Wednesday released its 2012 National Environmental Scorecard. Sen.

The Senate also stopped legislation to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline.   Read the report here: http://www.lcv.org/Scorecard-2012.pdf

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Rankings: Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Tom Udall tied in National Journal's ranking of the “most liberal” senators. “Blumenthal is not a firebrand like Bernie Sanders, but he casts liberal votes that are a reflection of his constituency and his philosophy,” University of Connecticut political scientist Ron Schurin told The Connecticut Mirror. “Although Sanders is an independent with very progressive views, he sometimes votes against Democratic positions on a bill as a protest, which may account for his absence from the list of most liberal senators,” the news website speculated. James Risch was deemed by National Journal to be the “most conservative” senator during the last session of Congress.    VA Claims: Backlog Breaking a backlog in veterans’ disability claims was a top priority of retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki when he became VA secretary in 2009. In 2009, it took an average of 161 days for the VA to determine whether the veteran is entitled to monthly payments for service-connected injuries or medical conditions. The average today is 273 days. Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, said it’s good that a million veterans a year get new benefits but the time it takes them to qualify is not. He will convene committee hearings on the issue next month, The Washington Examiner reported.   USPS: The best way to save six-day mail is to convince legislators to support Sen. Sanders’ Postal Service reform bill, Ed Schultz said Tuesday on WWRL-AM in New York, N.Y., and other stations. The Sanders bill and Rep. Peter DeFazio’s companion legislation in the House would “give them their budget back and … let them compete,” Schultz said.   Global Warming: Sens. Sanders and Barbara Boxer announced plans last week to try once more to draft laws that would benefit the environment and the economy, Former California EPA Secretary Terry Tamminen wrote for The Huffington Post.  The urban planning blog Planetizen compared a provision in Sanders’ climate bill to a program in Alaska where every resident received $872 last year from oil and gas industry royalties.

Sanders, Boxer Bill Gains Support:  There is growing grassroots support for legislation to combat global warming.  A bold new proposal by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer, chairman of the Senate environment committee, has attracted support from environment and consumer groups. The legislation also has drawn overwhelming public support from a record number of respondents to our online poll. The proposed tax on carbon emission would reduce the use of fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, encourage U.S. companies to move to cleaner forms of energy, increase efficiency of existing fossil fuels and help develop new technologies. Rebates to consumers would reduce the impact of the tax on their energy bills. The revenue raised also would be used to help invest in clean energy technologies and solve our budget problems. “We will never fully deal with this crisis until Congress passes strong legislation. Sen. Boxer and I are going to fight as hard as we can to do that, and we will work to rally support from American families all across this country that care deeply about their children and grandchildren's future, and want to protect them from this planetary crisis,” Sanders wrote in an op-ed published by The Guardian.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  USPS: Sen. Sanders joined 23 other senators in challenging the postmaster general’s authority to end Saturday mail delivery without congressional approval. The senators are asking for a legal justification, in writing, as to what Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe thinks gives him authority to unilaterally stop Saturday service, all-news radio KXNT-FM in Las Vegas reported on Monday.   Dairy: Sen. Patrick Leahy addressed the St. Albans Cooperative Creamery annual meeting. The Milk Income Loss Contract, a Leahy authored support program for farmers, expired last year. Leahy was able to get a temporary reauthorization of the program, however, and as a result Vermont farmers received $450,000 in payments. Speaking on behalf of Sen. Bernie Sanders, staffer Jenny Nelson urged farmers who received a check to give Leahy a round of applause, the St. Albans Messenger reported.   Climate Change: “Gamely plowing ahead despite an absence of support beyond party lines, Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sanders on Feb. 14 proposed a bill to impose a carbon tax, something this [Los Angeles Times editorial] page has been urging since 2007 but whose current prospects look dim.”   Citizens United: West Virginia lawmakers were urged to join a national attempt to undo a Supreme Court ruling that let corporations and wealthy individuals spend unlimited sums on political campaigns. The Charleston Gazette cited Sen. Sanders’ warning that the unregulated flow of cash into campaign coffers threatens to give America a government "of the rich, by the rich, for the rich."

Presidents Day in Vermont:    On Presidents Day we have the opportunity to reflect on our past leaders’ roots and the backgrounds that shaped their values. The Vermont values of universal freedom and equality were carried to the highest office in the country by two American presidents who called Vermont their birth-state.  Chester Alan Arthur was the 21st president of the United States, born in North Fairfield, Vt. on October 5, 1829. He was the son of a Vermont native, Malvina Stone and  William Arthur, an abolitionist Baptist preacher who immigrated to North America from Ireland. Arthur was a colonel in the American Civil War, in charge of outfitting and housing troops in New York. He was  elected vice president on the Republican ticket of 1880 and assumed the presidency after the assassination of President James A. Garfield. President Arthur continued his father’s quest to restore equality for all Americans after the end of Reconstruction, defending the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and increasing education funding for Native Americans.  Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president famously known as “Silent Cal,” was born in Plymouth, Vt. on Independence Day in 1872. Like Arthur, President Coolidge assumed the office after serving as Vice President when President Warren G. Harding passed away in 1923. President Coolidge received the news while visiting Vermont and signed the oath of office by light of a kerosene lamp, administered by his father, John Sr., who was a notary. Coolidge also fought for civil rights in a post-war era, reducing the influence of the Ku Klux Klan by keeping them from appointed office. He also signed the Indian Citizenship Act granting full U.S. citizenship to Native Americans while allowing them to retain their land and cultural rights.  Vermont can list Arthur and Coolidge with pride among its many citizens who have made a positive difference in American history. Both men are bound together by the unforeseen circumstances that bestowed the presidency upon them and by the actions that helped advance the tradition of equality and civil rights that Vermont still fights for today.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Pipeline Protest: Organizers said 35,000 people marched around the White House Sunday in opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, which environmental groups say would worsen the risks of climate change by encouraging development of Alberta's oil sands. Environmentalists have been encouraged by Obama's pledges to tackle global warming, first in his inaugural address and then again in the State of the Union speech. Last week, Sens. Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders introduced legislation that would tax carbon emissions, Bloomberg reported.   Global Warming: Sens. Boxer and Sanders on Thursday rolled out their legislation that would impose carbon emissions fees on producers and importers of coal and petroleum, among other features. Boxer said she wants the bill to come to the floor by summer.  A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said it is too soon to talk about specific climate measures, according to The Hill.   Climate Commentary: The Sanders-Boxer bill “would represent a major victory for the planet,” Chris Hayes commented Sunday on MSNBC. Sanders “thinks the winds are changing,” Thom Hartmann said on WRRL-AM in New York. Sanders and Boxer “focus us on our moral obligation to leave a country and a planet to our children that is not damaged and polluted,” Richard W. Caperton of the Center for American Progress blogged. “It will need support from the bottom, not just the top,” Princeton Professor and CNN contributor Julian Zelizer wrote. The Boxer-Sanders proposal “is the least economically damaging proposition,” according to Reason magazine online.  USPS: Sen. Bernard Sanders joined 23 other senators who signed a letter challenging the postmaster general’s authority to stop Saturday mail service without congressional approval. Sanders and Rep. Peter DeFazio last week also introduced legislation that would allow the Postal Service to generate new revenues by providing additional services, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported. Their proposal also would eliminate a requirement that the agency prefund retirement health care benefits for its employees 75 years into the future -- a requirement critics say has no precedent in the public or private sector, the St. Petersburg, Fla., Sun-Sentinel reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: Appearing at a news conference with Sen. Bernard Sanders, Senate Environment and Public Works Chairwoman Barbara Boxer said she plans to bring carbon tax legislation to the Senate floor in the coming months. The two senators initially would impose a $20 fee per ton on carbon and methane emissions. The panel’s ranking Republican, David Vitter of Louisiana, reiterated his opposition to a tax on carbon, Congressional Quarterly reported.   Symbolic: The Guardian’s assessment in a separate article was that “the bill is largely seen to be a symbolic initiative with little chance of becoming law so long as Republicans – and some coal and oil state Democrats – remain implacably opposed to widespread intervention in the economy.”    Climate Crisis: ”Unless we take bold action to reverse climate change, our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are going to look back on this period in history and ask a very simple question: Where were they?,” wrote Sen. Sanders in a column published online by the guardian. “Why didn't the United States of America, the most powerful nation on earth, lead the international community in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and preventing the devastating damage that the scientific community was sure would come?”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=db2a516c-3cb0-47da-a758-f743d30a6efb
The Week in Review:  Comprehensive legislation to reverse climate change was introduced in the Senate on Thursday by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer. A bill to save the U.S. Postal Service was proposed by Sanders on Wednesday. The Navy SEAL who shot Osama bin Laden is waiting, six months after he left the service, for VA disability benefits. Sanders met with him and announced that the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs will hold a hearing next month on the VA’s benefits backlog. And President Obama talked about the middle class Tuesday in the first State of the Union address of his second term.

Sanders, Boxer Propose Climate Change Bills: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=2a869a44-1597-42a8-b625-1a88db3febbc
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: A measure that Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced Thursday would tax carbon emissions and use 60 percent of that money on rebates to make up for the expected spike in utility bills. The proposal is co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, who heads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the Burlington Free Press reported.  Climate Change: Scientists say the global temperature may warm by up to 8 degrees this century. “It would mean cities in America being underwater. It would mean the price of food skyrocketing. It would mean people dying of heat stroke. So this is a major crisis that has to be dealt with and this is the most significant legislation ever brought forth to address that crisis," he told WPTZ-TV. “In fact, the crisis facing our planet is much more serious than [scientists] had previously believed,” Sanders said on Fox 44 and ABC 22.   USPS: Senators are urgently trying to save the struggling Postal Service after its announcement that it will cut Saturday delivery starting in August. Sen. Sanders and Rep. Peter DeFazio introduced legislation that would repeal the law under which the Postal Service prefunds 75 years of benefits for retirees in 10 years. The retiree health benefits have crippled the Postal Service and cost the agency $11.1 billion in the past year, the Pittsburgh Tribune Review reported.  Sequester: Senate Democratic leaders reached agreement Thursday on a $110 billion mix of tax increases and spending cuts to head off automatic spending cuts through the end of the year. But with even some Democrats tepid on the proposal, the chances of a deal before the March 1 deadline have receded. Sens. Tom Harkin and Sanders decried the 50-50 mix of cuts and taxes, after Democrats have swallowed far more spending cuts than tax increases over two years of deficit-reduction efforts, The New York Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: Sens. Bernard Sanders and Barbara Boxer today will present a comprehensive proposal to combat climate change, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Key provisions of the bill will include a fee on carbon and methane production, a tariff on oil and gas imports, and an energy rebate for affected families.   USPS: Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe took his controversial plan for five-day mail delivery before a congressional hearing Wednesday. About the same time Donahoe was asking the committee not to stop him from ending Saturday mail, other members of Congress were introducing legislation to do just that, The Washington Post reported. “Providing fewer services and less quality will cause more customers to seek other options,” said Sen. Sanders, who introduced the bill in the Senate as Rep. Peter A. DeFazio did in the House. Their legislation would keep six-day delivery, The Hill, Times Argus, WPTZ-TV and WNYT-TV in Albany, N.Y. reported.   VA Benefits Backlog: Sanders said the VA is “working very aggressively” to institute measures, including a paperless claim system, to help ease the backlog of claims awaiting processing, according to a report by the Center for Investigative Reporting. “We have a moral obligation to make sure that all our veterans receive the benefits they deserve,” Sanders told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.   VA Health Care: A decision by the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments to scrap an integrated health-records system for veterans is deeply disappointing to Sen. Sanders, the chairman of the Veterans Affairs committee, The Washington Post reported.     Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=5D20372E-8408-4459-A439-16E84971F190

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  State of the Union: President Obama “challenged Congress on Tuesday night to assist an American middle class squeezed by rising costs and stagnant wages, making clear that he will devote much of his second term to closing the income gap between rich and poor,” according to The Washington Post. “I look forward to working with his administration to create the millions of new jobs we desperately need, to improve our pre-school and educational system and to combat climate change,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on WCAX-TV and in the Burlington Free Press.   Global Warming: President Obama told lawmakers he intends to take bold action – with or without their help – to address global warming. Meanwhile, Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer and Sen. Sanders plan to unveil legislation Thursday that would put a price on carbon dioxide emissions and fund investments in clean-energy technology, Congressional Quarterly and The Nation reported. “It’s not clear Obama will invest any political capital to push for that or other climate change legislation,” according to Politico.   Sanders Meets ‘The Shooter’: The Navy SEAL who says he killed Osama bin Laden attended a series of private conversations Tuesday with congressional leaders about his wait for disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The SEAL met with nine lawmakers from both parties, including members of the leadership of both houses, and Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Fresno Bee reported.   USPS: The current travails of the U.S. Postal Service are a manufactured crisis. In 2006, acting at the behest of the Bush-Cheney administration, Congress mandated that the Post Office pre-fund 75 years of future health-care benefits for retirees over the course of 10 years. Sen. Sanders notes that simply ending this bizarre requirement and allowing the postal service to recoup billions in excess pension payments would put the USPS out of the red, Katrina vanden Heuvel said in an online column for The Washington Post.

Sanders Statement on State of the Union:   “President Obama gave a strong speech with a sensible set of priorities.

Sanders, Boxer to Introduce Major Climate Change Legislation:   Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) will hold a news conference on Thursday, Feb. 14 to announce comprehensive legislation on climate change. Boxer is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Sanders serves on the environment committee and also is a member of the Senate energy committee.  Under the legislation, a fee on carbon pollution emissions would fund historic investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. The proposal also would provide rebates to consumers to offset any efforts by oil, coal or gas companies to raise prices.   Environment and consumer leaders set to participate include Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org; Mike Brune, executive director of The Sierra Club; Tara McGuiness, executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund; Tyson Slocum, Public Citizen’s energy director; and David Bradley, National Community Action Foundation executive director.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama May Cut Social Security: The White House said Monday it remains willing to consider trimming the growth of Social Security benefits as part of a broader deficit-cutting deal. “I am not confident that the president will protect Social Security,” Sen. Sanders warned in Congressional Quarterly. “Wall Street billionaires and other supporters claim that changing the consumer price index is a ‘minor tweak.’ Tell that to the millions of senior citizens trying to survive on just $14,000 a year whose Social Security benefits would be cut overall by $112 billion during the next decade,” Sanders wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday by The Hill.   Global Warming: Sen. Sanders soon will introduce "the boldest piece of legislation" to move the nation's energy systems away from fossil fuels. The bill would combat climate change through a fee on polluters, WCAX-TV reported. "There will be a price on carbon. There will be massive investments in sustainable energy. There will be money made available to families who may end up paying higher fuel prices as a result of the transformation in our energy system," Sanders said.  Osama bin Laden Shooter on VA Waiting List: The Navy SEAL who says he killed Osama bin Laden is waiting for disability benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs nearly six months after leaving the military, according to Esquire magazine. Sen. Bernie Sanders announced on Monday that he would be holding hearings next month on what he called "a broken claims system,” the Sacramento Bee and Virginia Pilot reported. "It is simply not acceptable for any veteran to wait many months or years for the benefits that they are entitled to receive," said Sanders, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.   Treasury Secretary: Treasury secretary nominee Jack Lew faces questions about his work at Citigroup and an investment in a Cayman Islands fund when he testifies tomorrow before the Senate Finance Committee. Sen. Sanders opposes Lew because of his Wall Street connection, according to Bloomberg. “We need a Treasury secretary who will work hard to break up too-big-to-fail financial institutions so that Wall Street cannot cause another massive financial crisis,” Sanders said. Sen. Sanders asked Lew if he thought deregulation of Wall Street caused the financial crisis. Lew said he didn't consider himself an expert, National Public Radio reported.

Tax Fairness:  Senate leaders this week hope to settle on a plan to avoid nearly $1 trillion in federal spending cuts set to take effect under a so-called budget sequester set to begin on March 1. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday cosponsored legislation by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse to replace the across-the-board cuts. The proposal would raise $960 billion by closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthiest Americans and big corporations. “At a time when revenue is near a 60-year low in terms of GDP and when corporations are doing phenomenally well while the middle class in America is collapsing, it is absolutely appropriate to ask corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes so we don’t balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the young, the sick and the poor,” Sanders said on Monday. Sanders last Thursday proposed his own bill to stop letting profitable corporations shelter income in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax shelters (S.250). “Wall Street banks and large companies love America when they need corporate welfare. But when it comes to paying American taxes or American wages, they want nothing to do with this country. That has got to change,” Sanders wrote in a column last weekend for The Huffington Post.   Read the column here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/a-choice-for-corporate-am_b_2652176.html
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  End Tax Havens: Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed legislation to stop corporations from sheltering income in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. The legislation also would end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs and factories overseas. Sanders said his bill would generate more than $590 billion in revenue during the next decade, The Associated Press, Rutland Herald, Burlington Free Press and WCAX-TV reported on Sunday and Monday.   USPS: Sen. Sanders said eliminating Saturday mail delivery will hurt rural America while doing very little to improve the financial condition of the U.S. Postal Service, CBS Radio News reported in a broadcast Sunday on KOH-AM in Reno, Nev.   Protecting Veterans: When Ruth Moore was an 18-year-old in the Navy, she was raped by her supervisor. Decades later, Sen. Sanders helped Moore resolve her dispute with the VA, the Bangor Daily News reported. This week, Moore is headed to Washington, D.C., as Rep. Chellie Pingree introduces The Ruth Moore Act to reduce the standard of proof for victims of military sexual assault so that they can more easily obtain benefits.   Pope to Retire: Pope Benedict XVI announced Monday he would resign Feb. 28, the first pontiff to do so in nearly 600 years. The decision sets the stage for a conclave to elect a new pope before the end of March. The 85-year-old pope announced his decision in Latin during a meeting of Vatican cardinals Monday morning, AP reported.

A Choice For Corporate America: Are You With America Or The Cayman Islands - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/a-choice-for-corporate-am_b_2652176.html
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Corporate Greed: Sen. Bernie Sanders “took a stand against corporate greed” by introducing legislation last week to stop corporations from sheltering income in the Cayman Islands and to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. The AFL-CIO president said Sanders’ legislation "would increase investment, employment, and wages in the United States." The bill would raise more than $590 billion in revenue over the next decade – eliminating the need for nearly half the proposed austerity looming in the sequester, Thom Hartmann wrote for Truth Out.   A Choice for Corporate America: “When the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street drove this country into the deepest recession since the 1930s, the largest financial institutions in the United States took every advantage of being American. They just loved their country – and the willingness of the American people to provide them with the largest bailout in world history” wrote Sen. Bernie Sanders in The Huffington Post. “But just two years later … the major financial institutions did everything they could to avoid paying American taxes by establishing shell corporations in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.”   Treasury Secretary: Jack Lew, President Obama’s pick to be U.S. treasury secretary, is expected to come under fire for the administration's budget policies and a nearly $1 million bonus he received from bailed-out bank Citigroup when he testifies on Wednesday before a Senate panel vetting him for the job. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has said he will vote against Lew, Reuters reported.  Save the Post Office: Sen. Sanders released a statement calling on the GOP leadership in the House to work with the Senate and bring meaningful reform to the Postal Service, according to The Nation.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Tax Dodgers: Sen. Bernard Sanders said some of the same corporations that took taxpayer bailouts after the 2008 financial collapse now are evading U.S. taxes by using offshore tax havens. “They are American companies when they want to be bailed out. They are foreign companies when they do not want to help us with deficit reduction or job creation,” Sanders said Friday on The Ed Schultz Show. “It is past time to put the kibosh on tax evaders who are (legally) robbing federal and state governments of billions of dollars,” the Brattleboro Reformer said in an editorial supporting Sanders’ bill to close the loophole.   Lew Invested in Cayman Fund: Senate Republicans said Friday that they will press Treasury secretary nominee Jacob Lew about his one-time investment in a fund based in the Cayman Islands. According to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, Lew invested in a hedge fund based at the Ugland House in the Cayman Islands. So far, only Sens. Jeff Sessions and Sanders have announced opposition to Lew’s confirmation, Congressional Quarterly reported.   USPS: Instead of ending Saturday mail, as the postmaster general proposed this week, Sen. Sanders said on Friday that Congress should stop making the Postal Service sock away billions of dollars a year in an already-flush account for future retiree’s health benefits. He also suggested modernizing the Postal Service business model. “The goal is to turn the Post Office over in a way to make it relevant to the 21st century,” Sanders said on The Ed Schultz Show.

The Week in Review:  The need to create jobs and help working families still struggling to recover from a terrible recession are themes that Sen. Bernie Sanders hopes President Obama emphasizes in next Tuesday’s State of the Union address. The senator discussed his hopes for Obama’s second term in a Monday interview with PBS’s Tavis Smiley. On Wednesday, Sanders said Congress should block a U.S. Postal Service plan to stop delivering letters on Saturdays. And on Thursday, Sanders introduced legislation to help balance the budget and create American jobs by closing loopholes that let businesses shelter income in offshore tax havens. The senator discussed the Postal Service and tax havens in a Friday radio interview.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=3AAEA721-C925-4183-B206-AB5423EC82AD

Meet the top Wall Street and corporate tax dodgers here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Tax-Dodge-Report-3.pdf
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Tax Dodgers: Sen. Bernard Sanders introduced legislation Thursday that would close a loophole that allows U.S. corporations to avoid paying income taxes by keeping their profits overseas in countries with low corporate tax rates, the Times Argus, Bloomberg News, Chicago Sun-Times, The Hill, Think Progress and Raw Story reported. “If we’re serious about deficit reduction [then] corporate America, which is now enjoying record-breaking profits, is going to have to step up to the plate,” said Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee.  Jobs Shipped Overseas: “This is a jobs issue, not just a tax issue … because what we`re doing is encouraging corporations to move their manufacturing plants, their offices to other countries where the tax rates are much lower,” Sen. Sanders said on MSNBC. ”I think it warrants the support openly of the White House,” Ed Schultz declared.   Saturday Mail: Lawmakers wrestled Thursday with how to address Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe's announcement that the U.S. Postal Service plans to end Saturday mail delivery. A temporary spending measure, which expires March 27, includes language requiring six-day delivery. Sen. Sanders opposes Donahoe's decision and told The Washington Post that he would fight any effort to remove the six-day-delivery requirement from the next spending bill. On the CBS Morning News, Sanders said the move would send the postal service into a “death spiral” while “doing very little to improve the financial condition of the Postal Service.”  Education: Senators took issue Thursday with the Obama administration for showering big grants on a small number of states under a controversial program called Race to the Top. At a Senate hearing, Sen. Sanders told Education Secretary Arne Duncan that "a relatively small amount of the states received the bulk of the money,” Reuters reported. The Huffington Post said Sanders criticized Duncan's support for the competitive grant programs.

End Offshore Tax Havens:  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday introduced a bill to stop profitable corporations from sheltering income in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. The legislation also would end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs and factories overseas.  Sanders’ bill and a companion measure to be introduced in the House by Rep. Jan Schakowsky would yield more than $590 billion in revenue over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. “At a time when we have a $16.5 trillion national debt and an unsustainable federal deficit; at a time when roughly one-quarter of the largest corporations in America are paying no federal income taxes; and at a time when corporate profits are at an all-time high, it is past time for corporate America to contribute significantly to deficit reduction,” said Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  No Saturday Mail: Sen. Sanders opposes a U.S. Postal Service plan to stop Saturday mail delivery, the Rutland Herald, Fox 44, ABC 22 and WNYT-TV in Albany, N.Y. reported. Sanders said the move will send the post office into a “death spiral,” CBS News reported.   USPS: The Senate last year passed legislation to prevent the Postal Service from moving to a five-day week for two years, but the House never acted on it. Sanders helped draft the bill. He thinks ending services won't solve the financial problem, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspapers. Sanders pointed out that cutting Saturday delivery removes one of the Postal Service's "major competitive advantages,” The Washington Post reported online." He called for other ways to reform the mail service, Talk Radio News reported.   Tax Havens: Sen. Bernie Sanders will hold a news conference today in Washington, D.C., on legislation to stop profitable corporations from sheltering income in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens, according to The Associated Press.  Veterans Health Care: Congressional leaders overseeing veterans' issues on Wednesday criticized a decision by the Obama administration to move away from building a new computer system for storing the health records of troops and veterans. In a joint statement, Sens. Sanders and Richard Burr joined House veterans’ committee leaders in voicing concerns, AP reported. “I am deeply disappointed by the VA and Defense Department decision to back away from a commitment to develop and implement a truly integrated, single, electronic health record,” Sen. Sanders, chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, told Politico.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=09D878B1-8A40-461D-84A9-D06B071066CB
Tomorrow morning Sen. Sanders will introduce new legislation to stop profitable corporations from sheltering income in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. Sanders’ legislation also would stop tax breaks for companies that ship jobs and factories overseas.
Sanders to Fight for Real Postal Reform:  Sen. Bernie Sanders said today he will oppose a U.S. Postal Service plan to end Saturday mail delivery. “The postmaster general cannot save the Postal Service by ending one of its major competitive advantages.  Cutting six-day delivery is not a viable plan for the future.  It will lead to a death spiral that will harm rural America while doing very little to improve the financial condition of the Postal Service,” Sanders said. “Providing fewer services and less quality will cause more customers to seek other options.  Rural Americans, businesses, senior citizens and veterans will be hurt by ending Saturday mail,” Sanders added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Close Corporate Tax Loopholes: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday plans to introduce legislation to raise $590 billion over a decade by closing tax sheltering techniques used by big companies, Reuters reported. The article said Senate Democrats are divided about how to revamp the tax code, which has not been overhauled since 1986.    Protect Social Security: Sen. Chris Coons has lined up bipartisan support for his proposal to give startup companies a payroll tax credit for research and development costs. Coons’ proposal could face opposition from the liberal wing of the Democratic Caucus. For instance, Sen. Sanders has expressed concern about the impact of payroll tax cuts or credits on the Social Security Trust Fund, Congressional Quarterly reported.  EPA: Top Senate Democrats and independent Sen. Sanders urged President Obama to nominate a candidate with a strong record on protecting public health as the next EPA administrator. The push could be aimed at supporting California's air chief Mary Nichols, who has a record implementing the state's landmark climate change program, though the letter does not endorse a particular candidate, the trade publications Energy Washington Week, Clean Energy Report and Carbon Control News reported.  The Fed: A proposal for Virginia to issue its own currency sailed through the House of Delegates this week as Americans have grown increasingly suspicious of the institutions entrusted with safeguarding the economy. Much of the anger is directed at the Federal Reserve and some members of Congress have denounced what they considered Fed overreach. The Washington Post said a campaign by Sen. Sanders dubbed "Audit the Fed" culminated in a GAO report highlighting potential conflicts of interest.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders: Obama Should Focus on Jobs: Looking ahead to next Tuesday’s State of the Union address, Sen. Bernie Sanders hoped that President Obama will address the decline of the middle class and the need to create jobs. “What I want to hear the president say is that at a time when our infrastructure is crumbling, at a time when we need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to deal with global warming, he is going to push major legislation in those areas to create millions and millions of jobs,” Sanders told Tavis Smiley Monday on PBS.  Congress Ignores Jobs: Only two of the 10 priority bills laid out by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are related to jobs, the Huffington Post reported. “It is really quite incredible that we're not talking about jobs,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Huffington Post. “If senators go home to their states, they're going to find that people are unemployed in much too large a number – and underemployed.  EPA: Whoever President Obama picks to lead the Environmental Protection Agency will face criticism from the right as going too far in pushing job-killing regulations and criticism from the left as not doing enough to crack down on polluters. Fifteen Democratic senators joined independent Sen. Sanders in urging Obama last week to replace the outgoing EPA administrator with someone who'll retain a focus on public health and the environment, McClatchy reported.   Solar Power: Sen. Sanders was in Shelburne, Vt., on Monday to kick off Vermont's Co-Op Solar program. The partnership between a fuel dealer and solar company aims to save money for homeowners and businesses. Roof-top solar panels heat hot water year round saving hundreds of dollars on fuel bills, WPTZ-TV reported.

We have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on earth, worse today in the United States than at any time since 1928 before the Great Depression: http://youtu.be/VUrW3XrWeP4
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  USPS: Lawmakers are re-evaluating how to move forward this year on U.S. Postal Service reform after running out of time at the end of the last Congress. This effort will have to balance Sen. Bernie Sanders, who worked to limit the cost-cutting measures in last year’s bill, and Sen. Tom Coburn, who believes the measure never did give USPS the flexibility it needed, The Hill reported.   Obama: More Revenue Needed: President Obama said additional revenue is needed to bring down the U.S. deficit. Rather than raising taxes, the president proposed closing loopholes that he suggested allow wealthy Americans to manipulate their tax rates. “The average person doesn't have access to Cayman Island accounts," the president said in a pre-Super Bowl interview on Sunday with CBS News.   Reid: New Revenue Vital to Budget Deal: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Democrats will demand additional revenue as part of any deal to alter the mandatory spending cuts set to hit at the beginning of next month. The comments, made in an interview Sunday with ABC's "This Week," come as Senate Democrats weigh options for averting at least some of the March 1 cuts, known in Washington as the sequester, The Wall Street Journal reported.   Wind Power: Apparently undaunted by the public recriminations issued by Sen. Sanders last Monday, proponents of a moratorium on mountaintop wind began taking testimony Tuesday on a bill that would halt new development for three years, the Vermont Press Bureau reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Income Inequality: The economy has gained 5.5 million jobs out of the 8.74 million jobs lost in the recession and the stock market topped 14,000 on Friday for the first time since 2007, but MSNBC’s Ed Schultz said millions of people are still out of work, the economy shrank in the last quarter, and two-thirds of Americans are planning to delay retirement because of the financial losses. “We have the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on earth, worse today in the United States than at any time since 1928 before the Great Depression,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said.   Jobs: Real unemployment in January was greater than 14 percent, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday. To create jobs, Sanders said on MSNBC, “we need to invest significant sums of money rebuilding … roads, bridges, water systems, mass transit, et cetera” and “given the threat of global warming, we need to invest very heavily and create jobs in weatherization, energy efficiency and sustainable energy.”   Veteran Unemployment: The January unemployment rate for veterans was 7.6 percent. Senate Democratic leaders want to extend a program to provide one year of GI Bill benefits for unemployed veterans 35 and older who want to learn a new and marketable skill. Sen. Sanders is a cosponsor of the veterans’ jobs bill, Army Times reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=ae40d0bf-6618-443a-9bd4-ff14bd9f93a6

On Tuesday, Sanders chaired a hearing on the shortage of primary care doctors. On Monday, he told a news conference in Vermont that a proposed moratorium on wind power projects in the state would send a “terrible message” to the rest of the country.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Social Security and Veterans: Sen. Bernard Sanders on Thursday spoke out against a plan aimed at reducing the federal deficit by changing how Social Security and veterans’ benefits are calculated, the Rutland Herald reported. Sanders was flanked at a news conference in the Capitol by Sens. Jeff Merkley and Sheldon Whitehouse along with representatives from veterans, seniors, labor, disability and women’s organizations, The Huffington Post reported.   Social Security: Sen. Sanders is fighting to protect Social Security while House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan wants to lower cost-of-living adjustments and drastically cut benefits. “Despite the fact that Social Security can pay out every benefit for the next 21 years, my Republican colleagues and some Democrats are attempting to use the deficit crisis to cut Social Security benefits. That is wrong,” Sanders said on ABC 22 and Fox 44.  Wind Energy: Foes of ridgeline wind development descended on the Statehouse Thursday to counter statements by Sen. Sanders that a moratorium would send a terrible message to the rest of the country about Vermont’s commitment to address global warming, WPTZ-TV reported. “Activist Bill McKibben praised ridgeline development as has Sen. Sanders,” WCAX-TV reported. Sanders is “on the right side of the corporate battle for our energy future” according to a Rutland Herald editorial.   Defense Secretary: Former Sen. Chuck Hagel faced questions about his views on Iran and Israel at his confirmation hearing for secretary of defense on Thursday. Radio host Ed Schultz likes Hagel. “He could go into the Pentagon and get his arms around their budget. You’ve heard on this program, if you listen every day, Bernie Sanders saying the Pentagon is so big it can’t even audit itself.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=7FFF3754-A4F7-4976-A558-45C7280BE3CD

Hands Off Social Security and Veterans' Benefits:  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday was joined by a growing coalition of seniors, veterans and labor organizations against changing the consumer price index to cut Social Security and disabled veterans’ benefits.  Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Jeff Merkley also took part in the Capitol news conference. They were flanked by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka; AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond; Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America policy chief Tom Tarantino; National Organization for Women President Terry O’Neill and The Arc of the United States CEO Peter Berns.  “We are here today to tell the White House and the leadership in Congress: do not balance the budget on the backs of the elderly. Do not balance the budget on the backs of disabled veterans who have lost their arms, legs, and eyesight defending our country. Do not balance the budget on the backs of working families. Do not adopt the so-called chained-CPI,” Sanders said.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C3F6B75C-1C71-4D82-B1A6-C80784EF946E
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Social Security and Veterans: Sen. Bernie Sanders hosts news conference today to announce a growing coalition of seniors, veterans and labor organizations against using a so-called chained consumer price index to cut benefits for Social Security and disabled veterans, according to The Associated Press Daybook.  Veterans: The consequences of sequestration could hit veterans hard if Congress does not agree to a fiscal deal that would prevent across-the-board spending cuts, Sen. Sanders told The Washington Post Wednesday. Although the Department of Veterans Affairs is exempt, veterans could see programs outside the VA affected, including job training and housing vouchers.   Health Care: Sen. Sanders wants a greater investment in community health centers to meet the health care needs of 30 million more Americans who will be insured under the new national health care law, WCAX-TV reported on Wednesday. Sanders also backed incentives for medical students to become primary doctors. Joan McCarter at Daily Kos blamed the doctor shortage on partisan attempts to block funding for the Affordable Care Act.   Wind Power: Sen. Sanders’ opposition to a three-year moratorium on wind energy projects in Vermont was applauded by the St. Albans Messenger. “It’s to the senator’s credit that he took a principled stand in favor of wind and that he did it for the right reasons: if climate change is to be addressed, and if renewables are to be part of the response, then wind power is also part of the mix and Vermont has a responsibility to participate,” according to the editorial. “We rarely rush to the senator’s defense, but harpooning him as a corporate lackey is laughable,” the editorial added.

Tomorrow at 10:30am Sen. Sanders will hold a press conference on how enacting the so-called chained CPI would reduce Social Security and veterans' benefits.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Primary Care Crisis: Sen. Bernie Sanders chaired a hearing Tuesday on the shortage of primary caregivers in the country and the additional challenges that must be faced once 30 million more people are insured next year under the Affordable Care Act, Congressional Quarterly and Modern Health Care reported.   Doctor Shortage: A panel charged with helping devise solutions to the nation’s health care workforce crisis is having a workforce crisis of its own: It hasn’t been funded, and it’s never met. The lack of action was noted at a hearing Tuesday of a Senate subcommittee convened by Sen. Sanders, Politico reported. “In order for the promise of expanded coverage passed into law by ACA to become a reality, the provisions designed to reach those goals must be fully funded and implemented,” Sanders said.   Filibuster Reform: Republican senators, and many liberals, viewed a battle over Senate rules as a Republican victory because it left the filibuster intact, according to The Examiner. "This country faces major crises in terms of the economy and unemployment, the deficit, global warming, health care, campaign finance reform, education and a crumbling infrastructure," said Sen. Sanders, who voted against the measure. "None of these problems will be effectively addressed so long as one senator can demand 60 votes to pass legislation."  Wind Power: “In supporting wind power, Sanders is taking on corporations far more powerful and pernicious than Vermont’s wind industry. To the extent that wind power grows, the hold of the fossil fuel industry weakens. That puts Sanders on the right side of the corporate battle for our energy future,” an editorial in the Times Argus concluded.

A Crisis in Primary Health Care: http://youtu.be/aVL2g0nzWyU  Read Sen. Sanders' report: Primary Care Access: 30 Million New Patients and 11 Months to Go: Who Will Provide Their Primary Care?: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/PrimaryCareAccessReport.pdf
Primary Health Care in America:  A Senate panel on Tuesday examined a “major crisis” in primary health care at a time when 30 million more patients will soon get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and worsen an already acute doctor shortage. One in five Americans today live in areas where they do not have adequate access to primary care due to a shortage of providers, according to Sen. Bernie Sanders (the chairman of the Senate Primary Care and Aging Subcommittee.  “In our country today we are spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as any other major country yet our health outcomes in terms of life expectancy, infant mortality and disease prevention are not particularly good,” Sanders said. “One of the reasons for that is that we have a major crisis regarding primary health care access which results in lower quality health care for our people and greater expenditures.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=F891AB5D-BF58-459F-BB6E-89564D36F8AF
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Primary Health Care: Higher pay for specialists and the absence of any government policy on doctor training has led to an imbalance with primary care doctors, said Sen. Bernie Sanders in a report for a Senate subcommittee hearing today. Sanders said about 70 percent of U.S. doctors are specialists, whereas in the rest of the world 70 percent of physicians practice primary care, Bloomberg reported. Fifty-seven million people in the United States live in areas with a shortage of primary-care providers, according to Sanders, and as more people gain insurance and seek care – and baby-boomer physicians begin to retire – the situation will only grow worse. Sanders' Primary Health and Aging Subcommittee will address the topic in a hearing today, National Journal reported.   Wind Energy: Sen. Sanders held a news conference Monday to oppose a three-year moratorium on wind power projects proposed in the Vermont state Senate, The Associated Press reported. “If Vermont ceases new wind development the message will go out all across the country that even in progressive Vermont there is not a serious commitment to combating global warming,” Sanders said in reports in the AP report in the Bennington Banner, Brattleboro Reformer, Rutland Herald, Times Argus.   Global Warming: Sen. Sanders is going to introduce legislation in Congress to combat global warming by imposing a tax on carbon that will include "massive investments" in renewable energy. Sanders mentioned the proposal Monday during a Burlington news conference. He said targeting several thousand of the worst greenhouse gas emitters in the country can lead to significant greenhouse gas emissions, AP reported.   Veterans Mental Health Care: Veterans who have trouble getting timely mental health care from Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics should also have access to thousands of health care providers who care for military personnel and their families, according to Rep. Jeff Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. Sen. Snaders, the new chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said he's open to the idea, AP reported. “While we must do everything that we can to greatly expand the VA's mental health capabilities, I am open to exploring options outside of the VA for contracting services with public and private mental health providers, including Tricare," Sanders said.

Wind and Global Warming:  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday opposed a moratorium on wind power projects in Vermont that he said would send a “terrible message” to the rest of the country and set back efforts to stop global warming.  A member of the U.S. Senate environment and energy committees, Sanders urged state lawmakers to reject a three-year ban on wind power projects. “If Vermont ceases new wind development the message will go out all across the country, spread by the well-funded coal and oil companies, that even in Vermont – progressive Vermont – there is not a serious commitment to combating global warming,” Sanders said.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Wind Power: Sen. Bernie Sanders called a news conference on Monday to outline his opposition to a moratorium on wind power projects on Vermont’s mountain ridges, The Associated Press, Vermont Public Radio and WPTZ-TV reported. Sanders plans to introduce legislation in Washington to boost investments in wind and other renewable energy.   Global Warming: Sen. Sanders plans to propose a tax on fossil fuels modeled on Alaska's "fee and dividend" oil royalty rebates to state residents, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked about Sanders’ bill. “We have not proposed and have no intention of proposing a carbon tax.”   Media Monopolies: The Federal Communications Commission may ease a 1975 ban on mergers between a TV station and newspaper in the nation’s top-20 television markets. Sen. Sanders opposes the proposed rules change. “A vibrant democracy is not going to survive unless we have a vibrant media where we have different points of view and where it is owned by different segments of our society,” Sanders said during a forum last Thursday hosted by the USC Annenberg Center and the New America Foundation.   Senators Offer Immigration Plan: A bipartisan group of senators has agreed on a set of principles for a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system, including a pathway to American citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants that would hinge on progress in securing the borders and ensuring that foreigners leave the country when their visas expire, The New York Times reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Women in Congress: New Hampshire has the first all-female delegation in history, but Vermont is one of only four states that never have sent a woman to Congress. The main impediment seems to be the value the state has long placed on incumbency. There is a bottleneck of federal lawmakers in place who show no signs of stepping down; and there’s no one who suggests that they should, according to the Valley News. The current Vermont delegation consists of Sens. Patrick Leahy, 72, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, 71, an Independent; and Rep. Peter Welch, 65, a Democrat.   Leahy on Guns: As Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Leahy has a powerful role in advancing the Obama administration’s gun-control agenda but he risks angering constituents in gun-friendly Vermont, according to the Burlington Free Press. Some gun advocates cite the fate of former Republican Rep. Peter Smith when asked about their political power. Smith cosponsored a bill banning semi­automatic rifles in 1989, prompting an aggressive campaign against him in the1990 election by the NRA and local affiliates. He was unseated and the election went to independent Bernie Sanders, according to the Free Press.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Arrogant CEOs: A group of the country’s leading CEOs from the Business Roundtable this week proposed raising the eligibility age to 70 for both Social Security and Medicare, according to The Washington Post. Adopting their proposal would cause an “unparalleled disaster,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program. He called it “beyond arrogance” for Wall Street and business CEOs “who themselves have retirement packages that most people couldn’t begin to dream about” to propose balancing the federal budget “on the backs of ordinary people.”    The Terrible Recession: “We remain in the midst of a terrible, terrible recession … [and] we cannot forget the reality that tens and tens of millions of working people are really hurting,” Sen. Sanders said Friday on MSNBC. “Counting people who have given up looking for work … we are looking at almost 15 percent of our population who don't have jobs.”   Filibuster ‘Reform’: Sen. Sanders on Thursday voted against weak changes in Senate rules that left the worst filibuster abuses intact. Outnumbered minorities will still be able to block legislation to address global warming, jobs, the economy, deficit reduction and other critical issues, Sanders said Friday on MSNBC’s “The Ed Show,” and “Jansing & Company, The Ed Schultz Radio Show, The Thom Hartmann Program and the Randi Rhoades Show.

Bernie Sanders and others for its emphasis on civil rights and global warming. Congress began to set the stage for its own new session with a disappointing deal on what was billed as filibuster reform.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Votes No on Filibuster ‘Reform’: The tradition-laden Senate voted Thursday to modestly curb filibusters by making it a bit harder but not impossible for outnumbered senators to sink bills and nominations. The changes were approved by votes of 78-16 and 86-9. In both roll calls, Republican opponents were joined by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, The Associated Press, Bloomberg and Congressional Quarterly reported. “This country faces enormous crises. The American people want us to deal with them and it’s impossible to deal with them when you need 60 votes and a supermajority,” Sanders told The Hill.   ‘Why Are Democrats Such Wimps?’: “It's a huge disappointment. It's a wasted opportunity and it's one more time when Democrats just don't show any freakin' backbone. Good for Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders voted against this deal yesterday because he said it was a joke,” Bill Press commented on Current TV. “If Democrats don't get anything done on immigration reform, can't get judges passed through the Senate … because of filibuster, filibuster, filibuster, it's their own damn fault for not changing it when they had the opportunity ... Why are Democrats such wimps?”  Gas Prices: Costco was granted a land use permit to install gas pumps at its low-price store in Colchester, Vt. The competition could bring down high gas prices throughout the northwestern Vermont region, according to Sen. Sanders, the Burlington Free Press, WPTZ-TV, WCAX-TV, Fox 44 and ABC 22 reported. “I hope and expect gas prices throughout the region will go down saving families a substantial amount than what they are currently playing,” Sanders said.   Lew’s Citigroup Ties Questioned: A day after New Year’s in 2008, Citigroup announced that one of its most troubled units had a new chief operating officer: Jack Lew. In a sea of Wall Street traders and hedge fund managers, Lew stood out. He was a career government bureaucrat who had joined Citigroup 18 months earlier hoping to gain experience in the business world. Now he was getting more than he could have imagined.

NEWS: Sanders Votes Against Weak Filibuster Reform:  “The rule changes adopted today are a step forward in making the operations of the Senate more efficient and expeditious.  They are not enough.  “Most Americans grew up believing that in America the majority rules.  That is not the case in the Senate.  For many years now, especially since President Obama has been in office, it has taken 60 votes to pass any significant piece of legislation. When Lyndon Johnson was majority leader in the 1950s, he filed cloture to end a filibuster only once.  Majority Leader Reid has filed cloture 390 times.  “This country faces major crises in terms of the economy and unemployment, the deficit, global warming, health care, campaign finance reform, education and a crumbling infrastructure – to name a few.  In my view, none of these problems will be effectively addressed so long as one senator can demand 60 votes to pass legislation.

Mental Health Care:  The Senate health committee held a hearing Thursday on access to mental health services in America. It’s an issue brought into sharper focus after mass killings at Newtown, Conn., and other American communities. “We must make sure that mental health services are available to all Americans regardless of income,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the committee. “Today for low- and middle-income people living in rural areas it is especially difficult to find timely, affordable care.”  Sanders cited federal reports that more than 90 million Americans live in areas where there is a shortage of mental health professionals. Fewer than one-third of adults and one-half of children with diagnosable mental disorders will actually receive mental health services in a year. The access challenges are particularly acute in rural America where there are not enough psychiatrists and psychologists to meet the mental health needs of young people and seniors.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: Despite President Obama’s renewed attention to climate change in his inaugural address, the White House on Wednesday ruled out a tax on carbon emissions favored by many environmentalists. White House spokesman Jay Carney was asked about legislation that Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to introduce to charge companies a fee for carbon pollution. “We have not proposed and have no intention of proposing a carbon a tax,” Carney said, according to The Washington Times, C-SPAN and Environment & Energy Daily.  Jobs for Veterans: Helping veterans find jobs is one of the top legislative priorities for Senate Democrats. One of the first 10 bills introduced in the 113th Congress is a measure that seeks to get more veterans hired for civil service jobs; provide federal grants to encourage employers to hire veterans as first responders; expand small-business loans; and strengthen employment and re-employment rights. Sen. Sanders, the incoming Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman and cosponsor of the bill, said his panel “will be looking very seriously at how to improve veterans’ employment and training programs,” Navy Times reported.   Treasury Secretary: Senate Republicans on Wednesday offered encouraging words about President Barack Obama's Treasury nominee, Jack Lew, but withheld support. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have already endorsed him, but a number of Republicans and Sen. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, have said they think Lew should not serve as Treasury secretary, Reuters reported.   Filibuster Reform: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to win slight concessions to speed debate in the Senate, but he reportedly has dropped a plan that would have required senators who want to delay action on a bill they oppose to actually explain their position on the floor, a so-called talking filibuster. Without that requirement, Sen. Sanders conceded on MSNBC, “we’re simply not going to be able to address the serious problems facing the American people.” With what’s left of filibuster reform, he allowed, “there won`t be much in the way of teeth. What you`ll see is some improved efficiencies.” Sanders told Vermont Public Radio that reform is needed to bring critical legislation to the Senate floor for debate.

Sen. Sanders talks about the need for filibuster reform: http://youtu.be/Hqzc9J_c-J8
Coming up at 8:40pmET: Sen. Sanders will be on msnbc's The Ed Schultz Show talking about the need for strong filibuster reform.
Filibuster Reform Needed Now:  Sen. Bernie Sanders said today he strongly supports long-overdue filibuster reform to stop a single senator without explanation from forcing an extraordinary majority of 60 votes to advance legislation. “This country faces enormous problems in terms of jobs, global warming, health care, campaign finance reform, deficit reduction and many other important issues. The Senate has been blocked from considering many of these and other major issues of our day by a stubborn minority’s abuse of a rule originally designed to guarantee debate, not silence it,” Sanders said.

Jobs for Veterans:   Legislation to help veterans find jobs was introduced Tuesday in a package of top-priority bills filed on the first legislative business day of the new session of Congress. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the Putting Our Veterans Back to Work Act of 2013. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, co-sponsored the measure. “At a time when one in 10 post-9/11-era veterans are unemployed, this bill honors the sacrifice of the men and women who served in our armed forces by providing them with training to find jobs or helping them get their own small businesses off the ground,” Sanders said.  “The Veterans’ Affairs Committee will be looking very seriously at how to improve veterans’ employment and training programs,” Sanders added.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Global Warming: Congressional Democrats are weighing strategies for curbing greenhouse gases following President Obama’s inaugural pledge to redouble efforts on climate change. Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he is readying climate legislation he intends to introduce next month which would include a price on carbon and massive investments in sustainable energy, Congressional Quarterly reported.   Don’t Cut Disabled Vets’ Benefits: At Monday’s Salute the Heroes Inaugural Ball, Sen. Sanders, told CNN he is committed to protecting veterans from benefit cuts proposed by congressional Republicans. “Republicans are beginning to catch on. They're beginning to understand the American people do not think that it makes sense to cut back on programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' needs.”   Sanders: No on Lew: Jacob J. Lew, President Obama’s choice to succeed Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary, made the rounds of allies in the Senate on Tuesday ahead of a confirmation hearing. Sen. Sanders told Congressional Quarterly he would vote against Lew’s nomination citing concerns about Lew’s ties to Wall Street and the need for tough oversight of the financial services industry.   Gas Price Ripoffs: Why are gas prices in Chittenden, Franklin, and Grand Isle counties higher than elsewhere in Vermont as well as most other places in the country? Three Vermont House committees on Tuesday heard from Sen. Sanders who said the problem is not enough competition, The Associated Press reported.

A Welcome Emphasis on Global Warming:  Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday welcomed President Barack Obama’s support for action to combat climate change. “The president is right to make action on global warming a central goal of his administration. The overwhelming scientific consensus is clear. Unless we take bold action soon the temperature of our planet could rise by up to 8 degrees Fahrenheit.  That would be catastrophic.  The Senate is about to vote on more than $50 billion in aid to help recover from Hurricane Sandy and insurers tell us that is only a fraction of the price we will continue to pay for extreme natural disasters made worse by our warming planet.  “While the president can, and must, move aggressively to use executive powers to reduce pollution and reject harmful projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, he also must help lead an effort to pass strong legislation that moves our nation away from polluting fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  “Next month, I will introduce comprehensive legislation that will charge the fossil fuel corporations a fee for their carbon pollution. My legislation will end fossil fuel subsidies, and as the president called for, make historic investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. This bill will also ensure that all Americans receive a rebate to offset any efforts by the fossil fuel companies to jack up their prices.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Obama Inaugurated for 2nd Term: Sen. Bernie Sanders said, “I look forward to working with him to create the millions of jobs that our workers need, to provide health care for all Americans and to protect the social safety net for seniors, veterans, children and the poor,” according to the Burlington Free Pres. Obama “laid out a strong vision for how we must protect our planet” from global warming,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV. And “our first African-American president invoked our country's long history of advancing civil rights,” the senator said on WCAX-TV.   Social Security: President Obama has been too eager to go along with congressional Republicans to reduce Social Security benefits by lowering cost-of-living adjustments for millions of retirees, widows and orphans,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times. Shifting to a “chained” consumer price index also would take benefits away from more than three million disabled veterans and their families and result in across-the-board tax increases with a disproportionate effect on working families, Sanders said.   Treasury Secretary: Sen. Sanders has come out against the nomination of Jacob Lew to be treasury secretary in part because of his willingness to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare. “That's not the way you do deficit reduction,” Sanders told The Washington Post.   Obama’s ‘Progressive Agenda’: President Obama’s inaugural address announced “his progressive intentions for a second term: to defend the aims of the entitlement state, to take on climate-change deniers, to promote gay rights and equal pay for women, to extract the country from perpetual war,” according to Politico. Sen. Sanders voiced concern about potential cuts in safety net programs. “I think that's a mistake. Especially in the midst of a recession, we must not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. You got to ask large corporations and the wealthy to start paying their fair share of taxes.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=AD7BEB78-EE25-4819-BC1E-C048BFB58779
President Obama’s second inaugural address was eloquent in its simplicity and inspiring in its basic theme that we’re all in this together.   On the day our nation was marking the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., our first African American president invoked our country’s long history of advancing civil rights, as he put it, from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall.  As we rebuild our economy and as we bring an end to a decade of wars, the president laid out a strong vision for how we must protect our planet and renew our commitment to securing fundamental rights for all Americans.  As the president brings forth his budget and legislative priorities, I look forward to working with him to create the millions of jobs that our workers need, to provide health care for all Americans and to protect the social safety net for seniors, veterans, children and the poor. - Sen.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Inauguration Day: Barack Obama was formally sworn in to a second term on Sunday and ceremonially marked the beginning of another four years in the White House on Monday. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernard Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch have prime seats on the swearing-in stage alongside their wives and Gov. Peter Shumlin. Organizers also gave the congressional delegation about 1,000 free tickets for constituents to sit or stand on the lawn surrounding the U.S. Capitol during the ceremony, the Rutland Herald and Times Argus reported.   Treasury Secretary: Jacob S. Lew endorsed “a radical deregulatory approach to financial markets.” His “myopic view of the origins of the economic meltdown … hardly qualifies him for the top economic position in the Obama administration,” Robert Sheer wrote in a column for the Ashville (N.C.) Citizen Times. He quotes Sen. Sanders saying, “We need a Treasury secretary who is prepared to stand up to corporate America and their powerful lobbyists and fight for policies that protect the working families in our country. I do not believe Mr. Lew is that person.”   Class Warfare: “America's fiscal problems are a direct result of the Billionaire Class working behind the scenes of our democracy and syphoning off massive amounts of wealth for themselves while paying lower taxes than they've paid in a half-century. As Senator Bernie Sanders points out, a quarter of all profitable corporations in America pay zero federal taxes,” Thom Hartmann and Sam Sacks wrote for Truthout.   Budget: Senate Democrats plan to draft a budget blueprint that calls for significantly higher taxes on the wealthy, oil and gas companies and corporations doing business overseas. Democrats see the budget process as “a great opportunity” to pursue additional tax increases — and to create a fast-track process to push them through the Senate, Sen. Charles E. Schumer said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=D5A63AD4-4969-47CF-A98C-64B0590DB657

Peter Shumlin on Friday discussed, as Sanders put it, “what a progressive government can be doing at the state level.” Shumlin said Vermont is implementing the nation’s first single-payer health system and leads the nation in promoting energy efficiency. The senator and governor were guests on The Thom Hartmann Program.   Resisting Austerity: In an interview with The Progressive magazine, Sen. Sanders said cuts to social programs for the elderly, the poor, and the middle class were unacceptable in debt reduction negotiations. At a time when a quarter of profitable corporations pay no income tax "we are not going to balance the budget on the backs of the middle class,” Sanders said.

Legislature to Study Why Gas Prices Are So High in Vermont:   Three Vermont House committees are holding a two-part hearing on Vermont’s unusually high gas prices on Tuesday, Jan. 22. The Vermont House transportation, commerce, and judiciary committees will hold a hearing Tuesday afternoon at the Statehouse and a public meeting that evening in Colchester.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, who launched an investigation into gas prices last summer, will testify during the afternoon panel, which begins at 2:30 p.m. At 7 p.m., the committees will hold a two-hour public meeting at Colchester High School to hear from Vermonters who are concerned that gas prices in northwestern Vermont are substantially higher than in other parts of Vermont. The meeting will also explore why Vermonters are paying much more than the national average.  Continue to read here: http://sanders.enews.senate.gov/common/mailings/index.cfm?id=522
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Too Big to Fail: Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher fears “too-big-to-fail” megabanks might fail again and leave taxpayers on the hook to bail them out, he warned in a Wednesday night speech in Washington. Afterward, Fisher told The Fiscal Times that he had been called “unsolicited” by lawmakers from both parties. “A Tea Party activist will likely be as interested in this as you might have Sen. Sanders of Vermont,” Fisher said.  Banker Pay: JPMorgan Chase slashed CEO Jamie Dimon’s pay by half because an investment unit botched derivative trades that cost the bank more than $6 billion. “There is an extraordinary amount of anger at Wall Street; much more so I think than inside-the-beltway pundits perceive,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of Wall Street's most vocal critics, told Reuters. “Maybe some of the boards there are beginning to catch on to that.” Once that anger dies down, he expects Wall Street compensation to go back up.   Treasury Secretary: Jacob Lew, President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Treasury Department, has given only the barest hints of his views on finance. At his 2010 Senate hearing, Sen. Sanders asked Lew whether he believed that the “deregulation … pushed by people like Alan Greenspan [and] Robert Rubin contributed significantly to the disaster we saw on Wall Street.” A plethora of experts believe so, according to National Journal. Obama in 2008 thought so. But Lew didn’t.   Progressive Honor Roll: The most valuable progressive in the nation? “It’s Bernie Sanders,” The Nation’s John Nichols said. “Gotta be,” agreed radio host Bill Press. “A lot of people can be right. It's the person who can stand up, be right and then go out to the American people and talk about it on a regular basis. Bernie Sanders is no longer a senator. He is an educator. He spends his time educating,” Nichols said on Current TV.  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=8AFB4A7D-17B9-46D7-86B9-3053AD108589
Pentagon Priorities:  As the incoming chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Thursday that he hopes the next defense secretary improves ties between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Sanders also said that curbing defense contractor fraud and ensuring fair treatment of women and gays in uniform are topics that he plans to discuss with Chuck Hagel before the Senate votes on whether to confirm President Obama’s nominee to run the Pentagon.  Sanders said integrated health records and disability evaluations as well as improved coordination for employment opportunities are critical in addressing challenges that veterans and their families face in what should be a seamless transition from military service to civilian life.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Gun Violence: President Obama on Wednesday unveiled a plan to reduce gun violence which includes a ban on all military-grade assault rifles and mandatory background checks for all gun purchases. His proposals face an uncertain fate in a divided Congress. In Vermont, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Rep. Peter Welch all found common ground with the president, coming out in support of at least parts of his plan, according to the Burlington Free Press. “Congress must consider a comprehensive approach which includes a serious discussion about guns, the need for greatly expanded mental health services and ending gratuitous violence in the media. I intend to play an active role in that debate,” Sanders said.   Media Monopolies: Speculation about Fisher Communications being put up for sale raises the disturbing prospect of losing the last local owner of commercial broadcast television in Seattle. Sens. Maria Cantwell and Sanders confronted the Federal Communications Commission over its stealth plans to relax long-standing rules about cross-ownership of broadcast outlets and newspapers, according to a Seattle Times editorial. “We cannot live in a vibrant democracy unless people get divergent sources of information and have the opportunity to have serious debate about the major issues of the day,” Sanders said.   Independent Voice: Sen. Sanders was praised in a letter to the editor to The (Ronan, Mont.) Valley Journal. Bob McClellan praised Sanders’ stance on resisting austerity in deficit talks and opposing Jack Lew’s nomination for Treasury Secretary. “He cuts through all the political posturing, the evading of problems’ root causes, and the bobbing and weaving of so many politicians,” McClellan said. “He seems to speak for the vast majority of Americans.”   Professor Gutman: A former English professor is returning to UVM in the fall after serving as a chief of staff to Sen. Sanders. Huck Gutman left UVM in 2007 to pursue a career in politics in Washington and is returning to UVM as a poetry professor, The Vermont Cynic student newspaper reported.

Obama Proposes Laws on Guns:  President Obama announced on Wednesday that he will propose legislation that would ban assault weapons, limit high-capacity magazines, expand background checks for gun buyers and strengthen laws on gun trafficking. Sen. Bernie Sanders had this reaction: “As a nation, we must do everything we can to end the horror of mass killings that we have seen at Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., Tucson, Ariz. and in other American communities. As the president indicated, there is nothing more important than keeping our children safe.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=03459130-F288-4716-9C0F-DE1CEDAB1273

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Made in America: Wal-Mart announced on Tuesday that it would increase its U.S.-based product sourcing by $50 billion. Though the pledge lacked specifics, it would represent a significant investment in American manufacturing. Shopping blog Racked.com noted that Sen. Sanders has been involved in campaigns to promote American-made products.   Tapping Retirement Funds: As economic hardship for the working class grows, more and more workers are tapping their retirement accounts to pay for current expenses. The Washington Post reported a 12 percent increase since 2008 in people who are borrowing against 401(K)s to pay for mortgages, credit card bills and other bills. Some analysts are suggesting a broader solution to retirement than 401(K) pension plans.    Wall Street Pay: High-profile investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb is raising questions over executive compensation at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street Journal reported. His fund, Third Point LLC, recently purchased a stake in the investment banking firm. Third Point criticized director pay at Morgan Stanley in a letter to its clients, indicating that some executives are receiving unjustifiable benefits and bonuses for their performance.     Independence Day: On Tuesday, Vermont celebrated the 236th anniversary of its own independence declaration from both Britain and the state of New York. The state would remain an independent entity for 14 years until it was admitted into the Union as the fourteenth state. Politico has a profile on Vermont’s early history.  Working Poor: Many of the jobs added in the economic recovering are leaving workers struggling to pay for bills and necessary expenses. The Washington Post reported that the study found that 32 percent of working families earned less than double the poverty threshold, an increase of 4 percent since 2007.

Working Families:   New U.S. Census Bureau data show that the number of low-income working families in the United States increased to 10.4 million in 2011. The number was up for the third straight year. “This means that nearly one third of all working families—32 percent—may not have enough money to meet basic needs. At the same time, inequality among working families is increasing, as higher-income families receive a larger share of income relative to families at the bottom of the income distribution,” according to a report released Tuesday by the Working Poor Families Project.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Debt Ceiling: President Obama vowed Monday that he would not negotiate with Republicans over the federal debt ceiling, a move applauded on MSNBC by Progressive magazine writer Ruth Conniff. “The whole focus on deficit and debt is misplaced in a fragile economic situation, in a place where as Bernie Sanders has put it on this show so effectively, we`re looking at 15 percent real unemployment, we`re looking at people who are really living on the edge.”    Global Warming: The Sierra Club on Monday urged President Obama to use his “full executive authority” to combat climate change. Executive Director Michael Brune praised Sen. Sanders, who floated a climate bill last week, and Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer, who is creating a "climate change clearinghouse,” The Hill reported. Sanders’ climate bill would impose a fee on polluters and help green energy development, including biofuels, WHO-TV in Des Moines, Iowa, reported.  Treasury Secretary: Saying he will oppose the nomination of Jacob Lew to be treasury secretary, Sen. Sanders voiced concern over Lew’s background as a Citigroup executive leading up to the 2008 financial collapse, according to Bloomberg. Sen. Charles E. Schumer said Monday there would be “hardly any opposition” to the nomination despite strong complaints from Sens. Jeff Sessions and Sanders, Congressional Quarterly reported.   The Fed: Sen. Sanders four years ago said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke “missed the boat on the most significant economic crisis since the Great Depression” and “we need a whole new direction in the Fed.” Sanders’ criticism of Bernanke was invoked by a MarketWatch columnist advocating the appointment of outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to lead the central bank.

Misguided Social Security ‘Reform’ - The New York times  At the end of last year, just shy of the 11th hour in the fiscal cliff negotiations, President Obama made an offer that included a Republican-backed idea to cut spending by lowering the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits. The move shocked Congressional Democrats and dismayed Mr. Obama’s liberal base.  The offer, however, was rejected by House Republicans who could not stomach the tax increases and other concessions that Mr. Obama demanded as part of the deal. The talks moved on, and when all was said and done, Republicans did not get the lower cost-of-living adjustments (known as COLAs) and Mr. Obama did not get the concessions he had sought.  But that is not the end of the story. As the next round of deficit reduction talks gets under way, the administration seems determined to include the COLA cut in any new package of spending reductions. Rather than using the issue as a bargaining ploy, the administration appears to have embraced it as a worthy end in itself.  Is it? In a word, no.  That is not to say that Social Security should be off the table. There are reforms that are eminently sensible, if only the political will could be found to enact them. But reducing the COLA is not a sound idea now and may never be.  At issue is the way inflation is calculated. The administration’s offer in the fiscal cliff talks — and the approach long advocated by Republicans — calls for using a new measure of inflation, called the “chained” Consumer Price Index, to calculate the COLA.  Unlike the gauge of inflation currently in use, the chained index captures the ability of consumers to adjust their spending across categories as relative prices change — for instance, spending less on fuel as gas prices go up and more on groceries as food prices go down. Such substitution causes the chained C.P.I. to rise more slowly than the current measure, which would result in a lower annual COLA and huge budget savings. The move to a chained C.P.I. would reduce benefits by some $135 billion over 10 years, and far more in later decades because of compounding.  The administration and other proponents of switching to a chained C.P.I. contend that it is a technical fix in the interest of greater accuracy, not a benefit cut per se.  But that claim does not stand up to scrutiny. The chained index is in many ways a better method of tracking price changes for the broad working population, but there is no compelling evidence that it is better for computing the Social Security COLA.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Global Warming: Sen. Bernie Sanders says the warmest year on record in the United States and in Vermont has persuaded him it's time to get serious about climate change. The independent lawmaker says he plans to introduce legislation that would include a tax on greenhouse gas emissions from the biggest polluters, more money for energy efficiency and clean energy research and development, the Rutland Herald, Brattleboro Reformer and Caledonian-Record reported.   Wind Energy: Sen. Sanders’ letter to the editor of The Wall Street Journal objecting to the paper’s opposition to wind subsidies was “a masterpiece of complaint: clever, direct, deadly,” according to the Beatrice (Neb.) Daily Sun.   Debt Clash: The showdown over the nation's debt ceiling could force the government to consider drastic steps to manage its limited cash, including delaying trillions of dollars of payments to employees, Social Security recipients, contractors and others. The Obama administration has said it has no backup plan to pay the government's bills if Congress refuses to raise the $16.4 trillion federal borrowing limit. The White House said Saturday in a statement that "there are only two options to deal with the debt limit: Congress can pay its bills or it can fail to act and put the nation into default,” The Wall Street Journal reported.   Water Bottle Ban: UVM is the latest university to ban on-campus sales of bottled water. "Bottled water is a symbol of our culture's obsession with commodifying things that should be public trust resources," says Mikayla McDonald, a recent graduate, who helped launch the bottle ban campaign, NPR reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Obama Faces Heat from the Left: President Obama is coming under pressure from liberals to appoint strong consumer advocates atop the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the No. 2 spot in the Treasury Department, The Hill reported. Sen. Bernie Sanders said people want the federal government to crack down on high credit-card interest rates and fraud on Wall Street. “People want the president to begin to stand up and address some of those issues,” Sanders said.   Treasury Pick Panned: Sen. Sanders opposes Obama’s choice of Jacob Lew as treasury secretary because the former Citigroup executive won’t stand up to Wall Street, the senator told MSNBC on Friday. "We don’t need a treasury secretary who thinks that Wall Street deregulation was not responsible for the financial crisis," Sanders said on Democracy Now. "As a supporter of the president, I remain extremely concerned that virtually all of his key economic advisers have come from Wall Street," Sanders said in the Montgomery (Ala.) Advertiser. Sen. Patrick Leahy supports Lew, Seven Days reported online. “Lew deserves, and has earned, a quick confirmation,” according to a Scripps Howard editorial that noted Sanders’ opposition.   Global Warming: Climate legislation to be introduced by Sen. Sanders could raise $1 trillion by putting a fee on greenhouse gas emissions and would use the proceeds to make a “historic investment” in energy efficiency and renewable energy, Darren M. Springer, Sanders' chief counsel, told Bloomberg News.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=8354d6a5-d6b9-4d6e-a2af-745d6af4a79c
The Week in Review:   Last year was the hottest year ever recorded in the United States, the government announced on Tuesday. Sen. Bernie Sanders said will introduce legislation to deal with the global warming crisis in a way that is “aggressive but achievable.” President Obama on Thursday nominated his chief of staff, Jacob L. Lew, to be his new treasury secretary. Citing Lew’s ties to Wall Street, his views on bank deregulation, and his willingness to cut Social Security benefits, Sanders announced that he would vote no when the Senate decides whether to confirm the nomination. “The Soul of America,” a Sanders column about economic justice, was published Wednesday in The Huffington Post. And a Vermont-born congressman who helped change America during the Civil War is getting well-deserved attention because of a new movie, “Lincoln,” which garnered a slew of Academy Awards nominations on Thursday.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders Opposes Treasury Nominee: President Obama announced Thursday that he was nominating his chief of staff, Jacob L. Lew, to be his new Treasury secretary. Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he would not vote for Lew. Sen. Sanders criticized Lew's role in budget negotiations where the White House agreed to consider changes in Social Security cost-of-living increases and reductions in Medicare benefits, The Associated Press reported.  “I am really tired of the president, and I support the president, continuing to appoint people who come from Wall Street. We need people… who are going to have the guts to stand up to Wall Street,” Sanders said on MSNBC.   Income Inequality: Are you optimistic that income inequality will be addressed in a meaningful way during a second term with the Obama administration? Ed Schultz asked Sen. Sanders. “Am I confident? No. Do I believe that is the moral issue of our time? Yes. Do I believe that that is what the American people overwhelmingly want? I do. The statistics that you have brought forth, where you have a handful of people on the top owning tremendous amounts of wealth, and the vast majority of the American people owning very little … is not only morally wrong, Ed. It is very, very bad economics,” Sanders said on MSNBC.  Economic Justice: “In recent years, the middle class and working families of our country have seen a significant decline in their standard of living.  At the same time, the wealthy and large corporations have done phenomenally well.  Now, as we struggle to lower deficits and create new jobs, the largest corporations in this country and the wealthiest people must be asked to play a significant role,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Friday by The Caledonian-Record.   Shumlin Inaugurated: “I am … humbled to be joined today by the best congressional delegation in America. Senator Leahy, Senator Sanders, and Congressman Welch, we welcome you to the Statehouse and thank you for your service to our great state,” Gov. Peter Shumlin said in his inaugural address printed by the Times Argus.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=7F987289-2BBF-4712-93D0-D8349231535F

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Treasury Secretary: President Obama this afternoon will nominate White House Chief of Staff Jacob Lew for treasury secretary. Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against Lew’s nomination in 2010 to head the Office of Management and Budget after Lew testified that he did not think deregulation of the financial industry was a “proximate cause” of the 2008 financial crisis, The Hill and Bloomberg reported.   Fed Conflicts: An outspoken Senate critic of the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that he would reintroduce legislation to ban bankers from the boardrooms of the 12 regional Fed branches. Citing potential conflicts of interest and using JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to illustrate his point, Sen. Sanders called for a prohibition on all financial industry executives serving as regional Fed directors, Reuters, Bloomberg, United Press International, the Washington Examiner, The Hill and Law 360 reported.  A.I.G.: Afraid of looking like a world-class ingrate, AIG on Wednesday decided against suing the federal government over the $182 billion bailout that saved the giant insurance company from collapse, The Washington Post reported. A public uproar had erupted over reports that the company was even considering whether to join the $25 billion lawsuit. Sen. Sanders told the Rutland Herald that it a lawsuit by A.I.G. would have been “preposterous”.   Global Warming: Ramping up calls to take on global warming in the new session of Congress, Sen. Sanders is floating legislation to impose fees on greenhouse gas emitters, The Hill and truthdig reported online.   The Soul of America: “The great debate taking place in Washington now has relatively little to do with financial issues. It is all about ideology. It is all about economic winners and losers in American society … It is all about the soul of America,” Sanders wrote in The Huffington Post.

Fox Guarding the Chicken Coop:   With the departure of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Sen. Bernie Sanders announced on Wednesday that he will reintroduce legislation that would prohibit financial industry executives from sitting on the 12 regional Fed boards of directors. “Jamie Dimon was the poster child for why we need to end the serious conflicts of interest at the Fed, but he was not alone. Two-thirds of the directors at the New York Fed are hand-picked by the same bankers that the Fed is in charge of regulating,” said Sanders, who had called for Dimon’s resignation. “Allowing Wall Street CEOs to serve as Federal Reserve directors and hand-pick its members and staff is a clear example of the fox guarding the henhouse.”  Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=4ADC0D3B-67DE-4C2E-8F5A-30635241EAFB
The Soul of America - By Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), The Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bernie-sanders/the-soul-of-america_b_2439576.html
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  New York Fed: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has left the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, more than six months after lawmakers called for his resignation because of JPMorgan's multibillion-dollar trading scandal. Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced a bill that would prevent bank executives from serving on the boards of regional Fed banks, the American Banker and Bloomberg News reported. Sanders had also pushed for a 2011 study from the Government Accountability Office that called on the Fed to take steps to prevent conflicts of interest on the boards of its regional banks. "This is not just a perception problem - the problem is real," Sanders said.   McConnell is ‘Dead Wrong’: Sen. Sanders said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was “dead wrong” when he said that the tax debate is over and now it’s time to cut spending. “Sen. McConnell is dead wrong when he rules out additional revenue as part of the solution to our deficit crisis,” Sanders said in a statement Monday. “He is also wrong when he suggests the solution to the deficit situation is to cut Social Security, veterans’ benefits, Medicare and Medicaid,” The Hill reported online.   Hottest Year on Record: 2012, the year of a surreal March heat wave, a severe drought and a massive storm that caused broad devastation in the mid-Atlantic states, turns out to have been the hottest year ever recorded in the contiguous United States, The New York Times reported. Scientists expressed doubt that such a striking new record would have been set without the backdrop of global warming caused by the human release of greenhouse gases.   Flu Outbreaks: U.S. emergency rooms have been overwhelmed with flu patients, turning away some of them and others with non-life-threatening conditions for lack of space. Forty-one states are battling widespread influenza outbreaks, ABC News reported.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=12A55AAC-3692-48BC-97EC-EE51CF98BDBB

The 113th Congress:   Bernie, the longest serving independent in congressional history, is embarking on his second term in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn into the 113th Congress on Thursday by Vice President Joe Biden. Sen. Patrick Leahy accompanied Bernie to the well of the Senate chamber for the ceremony.  "I want to thank the citizens of Vermont for sending me to the Senate for a second term," Bernie said. "In these very difficult economic times, I will continue my efforts to fight for the working families of our state and country. We need to create millions of good-paying jobs, health care for all and deficit reduction which is done in a way that is fair – and not on the backs of vulnerable Americans. I also intend to bring forward sweeping legislation to transform our energy system and address the crisis of global warming.” As the incoming chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Bernie will be working with the veterans’ community to make sure that all veterans receive the benefits to which they are entitled.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Sanders: McConnell is ‘Dead Wrong’: Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday called Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell “dead wrong” for declaring that the “tax issue is over” after last week’s fiscal agreement. Added Sanders: “Revenue is very much the issue. The American people have been very clear. They do not want to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. They do want to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay more in taxes,” Sen. Bernie Sanders said on MSNBC. “Sanders has a point. Polls show not just Democrats and liberals but independents and moderates and even majorities of Republicans oppose making big cuts, or making any cuts to Social Security and Medicare. So that is a position on which Sanders is correct.” Michael Tomasky of Newsweek magazine said on MSNBC.   Defense Secretary: President Obama on Monday nominated former Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to be defense secretary, and top White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to be CIA director. Obama pressed the Senate to confirm them quickly. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he looks forward to confirmation hearings, Seven Days reported. Sen. Patrick Leahy backed both of the president’s picks. Democrats have 55 votes in the Senate including independents Sanders and Angus King. Republicans have 45. Sixty are needed for confirmation, Yahoo News reported.  Dimon Out at NY Fed: JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon has quietly left the New York Federal Reserve board of directors  Critics last year saw at least an appearance of a conflict of interest after JPMorgan, despite the Fed’s oversight, suffered an embarrassing $6 billion loss in a risky bet. “This is a clear example of the fox guarding the henhouse," Sen. Sanders said. Elizabeth Warren, now a senator from Massachusetts who will sit on the Senate Banking Committee, also called on Dimon to step down, the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune reported.   Gas Prices: Sen. Sanders last summer asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate gas prices in Northwestern Vermont. Sanders said consumers were being ripped off, and he blamed the area's gas retailers for keeping prices artificially high simply. The FTC has since reported that prices were higher than its projections, but told Sanders no further investigation is planned, Vermont Public Radio reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Media Monopolies: According to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders – an independent from Vermont and a leading opponent of media consolidation – 50 companies owned 90 percent of the American media in 1983. Today, that same 90 percent is controlled by six companies: GE, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS. “In short, it amounts to a monopoly on what we hear, and what we view, on TV and radio,” Jim Martin wrote in a Denver Post column critical of a Federal Communications Commission proposal to relax rules on media ownership.   Fiscal Cliff Bill Falls Short: The so-called fiscal cliff legislation signed into law by President Obama is not a good bill. But it was better than the alternative, which is why I voted for it. The alternative — doing nothing — would have thrown this country back into a recession with nearly $4 trillion removed from the economy,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column published Monday by the Rutland Herald.   Sanders is Right: In an e-mail to constituents, Vermont’s own Sen. Sanders vowed to continue to protect Social Security and resist efforts to change how the program’s cost-of-living adjustments are calculated. Not surprisingly, his approach to balancing the budget centers on the revenue side. He says it’s high time for corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes. After seeing the fact sheet Sanders distributed, we couldn’t agree more,” concluded a Brattleboro Reformer editorial published Monday by the Bennington Banner.  Battle Lines Drawn on Budget: Republicans won't accept further tax increases in coming budget and debt negotiations, the party's Senate leader said Sunday, putting GOP lawmakers on a collision course with Democrats over raising the government's borrowing limit, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Watch Sen. Sanders discuss the issues of the week on Brunch with Bernie: http://youtu.be/l0L8F_6llCA
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Social Security: Sen. Bernie Sanders was disappointed that President Obama wasn't more aggressive during the budget negotiations in standing up to what he calls a "right-wing, extremist Republican Party." His advice to the president for his second term is to stand firm on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as to push for corporations to start paying their fair share in taxes. "If the president stands firm ... he will have the overwhelming majority of Americans behind him," Sanders told National Public Radio.   Social Security: "We've got to make the president and Republicans and any Democrats that want to cut Social Security an offer they can`t refuse, and that is tens of millions of people have got to make it very clear to Congress -- Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit," Sanders said Friday night in an interview with MSNBC's Ed Schultz, The Hill blogged.   Progressives: “What being a progressive is about right now is standing up and fighting for working families,” Sen. Sanders told NPR. Is Obama a progressive? “No,” Sanders said. “[H]e is kind of a centrist somewhere in the middle of the Democratic Party but no I don’t think he is a progressive.   Tax Breaks for the Rich: In a column published Sunday by the Burlington Free Press, Sanders criticized tax breaks for the wealthy included in the year-end budget agreement. He cited an inheritance tax break for the richest 0.3 percent of Americans and the extension of Bush-era tax cuts on income, capital gains and dividends for households making between $250,000 and $450,000 a year. “The wealthiest Americans, whose effective tax rates are very low, are going to have to take much more responsibility for deficit reduction than this agreement provides.”   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=9d20a78d-2cb5-43ee-acde-c7e84135da9f

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):   Media Monopolies: The Federal Communications Commission has proposed rule changes that would allow greater media consolidation in big cities. “More media consolidation … would result in less local control, fewer outlets offering differing viewpoints, and less ownership diversity,” Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote in a column published Saturday by The Boston Globe.   Corporate Tax Evaders: “Mitch McConnell was on the floor of the Senate saying the revenue discussion is over. Well, not for me. The truth of the matter is that right now you have one out of four profitable corporations in America paying zero in federal taxes … So the question is whether or not we cut programs that working families and lower income people desperately depend upon, or whether we ask the wealthiest people and largest corporations all of whom are doing very, very well to start paying their fair share of taxes,” Sanders said Friday on The Thom Hartmann Program.   The Soul of America: “What the Republicans want to do is destroy the social safety net that has existed in this country since the 1930s. They want to give more tax breaks to people who don`t need it and decimate the programs that working families and the middle class desperately depend upon. This is a fight for the soul of America,” Sen. Sanders told Ed Schultz Friday on MSNBC. Will President Obama stop cuts in Social Security benefits? Sanders was asked. “I am not confident that the president will protect Social Security,” the senator answered.

Coming up at 8pmET: Sen. Sanders will be on The Ed Schultz Show talking about the budget and his fight to protect Social Security.
The Week in Review:   The Senate and House were in session on New Year’s Day for roll call votes on an agreement to roll back income tax increases that were set to take effect this year on the vast majority of Americans. The bill also raised taxes for the first time in two decades on the wealthiest Americans, but not by as much as President Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders and the vast majority of Americans had wanted. Sanders said the final product wasn’t a good bill, but doing nothing would have been worse. After months of negotiations over how to avoid a so-called fiscal cliff, Obama signed the measure on Wednesday. At noon on Thursday, a new session of Congress opened with swearing-in ceremonies.  Sanders took the oath of office for a second term extending his record as the longest serving independent in congressional history.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  113th Congress: Vice President Joe Biden administered the Senate Oath to Sen. Bernard Sanders during a swearing-in ceremony Thursday on Capitol Hill in Washington, The Associated Press and WPTZ-TV reported.    Senate Progressives: The progressive movement sees the 2013 class of liberal senators as a historic opportunity to shift the Democratic Party to the left. Four progressive incoming senators join Sherrod Brown, Sheldon Whitehouse, Sanders, Jeff Merkley and Al Franken, CBS News reported online. Elizabeth Warren is “left of Bernie Sanders on some issues,” Politico’s Jonathan Allen said on MSNBC.   Fiscal Fallout: Sen. Bernie Sanders was critical of the compromise despite voting in favor of it. “It’s not a good piece of legislation by any means,” he said. “I gave some thought to voting against it, but upon reflection, it’s clear to me that the alternative would have been a lot worse.” At the very least, Sanders said, the compromise spared middle-class Americans from tax increases and continued unemployment benefits for those who are out-of-work, as well as veterans’ benefits for those who have served in the military, while putting off for at least two months potential cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, the Valley News reported.   Fiscal Cliff: What’s Next?: “Making the wealthy and large corporations pay a few dollars more in taxes is not the moral or economic equivalent to cutting Social Security benefits for a senior citizen trying to stay alive on $15,000 a year, throwing elderly people off Medicare, or cutting benefits for disabled veterans,” Sen. Sanders wrote in a column in the Times Argus.   Continue reading here: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=D4132017-DF55-4F9C-9C05-78FA6CA766A3

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Fiscal Fallout: When negotiations begin in coming weeks to reduce the deficit, the lack of spending cuts in the legislation that averted the fiscal cliff will put pressure on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, analysts said Wednesday. Key backers in Congress said will not give in to pressure to cut benefits. “If we are going to protect programs that working families desperately need and create the millions of jobs our economy needs we need more revenue,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Boston Globe. He noted that government revenue is now 15.4 percent of gross domestic product, the lowest in 60 years. He argued that the wealthiest Americans and corporations should be paying more taxes. “We need more revenue from the wealthy and large corporations, so what I will do as part of this process is make sure we close these loopholes and ask corporations to start paying their fair share,” Sen. Sanders told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell.   Protect Social Security: “Republicans — and some Democrats — want to curtail Social Security, veterans’ benefits, Medicare and Medicaid — that’s not a secret — and some of us are going to be fighting to say no,” Sen. Sanders told Politico. He is the author of a letter sent by 29 Senate Democrats in September demanding Obama back off Social Security cuts by changing the index for inflation. “It is absolutely imperative the president and Democratic leadership stay strong on this issue. If they do, we will win,” added Sanders.   Protect Veterans: Sen. Sanders led seniors and veterans groups in stopping retirement and disability benefits from being cut in the year-end fiscal deal, according to The Ed Schultz Show. This legislation defeated efforts to cut benefits for Social Security recipients and disabled veterans, something I've been working very hard on,” Sanders said on ABC 22 and Fox 44. “I will continue fighting to make sure cuts in Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans are not part of any future budget deal,” Sanders said on WPTZ-TV.   Tough Call: “The ‘fiscal cliff’ agreement was not a good piece of legislation, but not passing the bill would have been much worse," Sanders said in the Brattleboro Reformer, Seven Days and vtdigger.org. “It was a tough vote. I would not be honest with you if I didn’t tell you I gave some serious thought to voting no,” Sanders told Elliot Spitzer on Current TV.

Fiscal Bill Fallout: http://youtu.be/iGRPcLVxf0g  “This agreement preserves incentives for the development of clean energy by encouraging companies that are creating jobs in America and helping reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. That is a win-win for our economy and our environment. In Vermont and across the country, hundreds of wind manufacturing plants already are producing wind turbines, and the industry is providing jobs for 75,000 American workers. The fact that we have doubled wind generation since 2008 is an American success story. Extending the Production Tax Credit means we can continue the tremendous growth in wind and other safe, clean, renewable sources energy that must be developed if we are to reverse global warming.

Coming up at 1:30pmET: Sen. Sanders will be on msnbc's Andrea Mitchell Reports talking about the budget agreement.
Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Congress Sends Fiscal Deal to President: The House late Tuesday sent President Obama a Senate-passed bill that raises taxes on individuals who make more than $400,000 and locks in tax cuts for income below that level. The measure was approved 257 to 167, with 85 Republicans joining 172 Democrats in voting to allow income taxes to rise for the first time in two decades for the wealthiest Americans. The agreement was “a small step forward,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told The Boston Globe. “At a time when we have gross inequality, we can and should do a lot more in bringing more revenue into the government.”   Vermonters Vote Yes: Vermont Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders both voted in favor of the measure that passed 89-8 in the Senate early New Year’s Day. In a television interview on Sunday, Sanders said the deficit reduction debate boiled down to asking the wealthiest people to help with the nation's debt at a time when “we have a middle class that is in significant decline,” the Bennington Banner reported.   Renewable-Energy Tax Breaks Pass: The fiscal deal included a $12 billion extension of a wind-power tax credit and other support for renewable energy. The package’s tax provisions give relief to renewable energy companies from manufacturers building wind turbines to refiners developing facilities to make fuel from wood, according to The Wall Street Journal.   Dairy Fix: The fiscal bill that cleared Congress Tuesday includes a provision to avert a sharp rise in consumer prices for milk that could have been triggered by the expiration of the 2008 farm bill. A nine-month extension of the farm bill was added to the fiscal-cliff package. Sen. Leahy took credit. “Thanks to Leahy’s efforts, the bill will continue the MILC safety net,” the Burlington Free Press reported.

Today's news from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.):  Senate Avoids ‘Fiscal Cliff’: The agreement primarily targets taxpayers who earn more than $450,000 per year, raising their rates for wages and investment profits. At the same time, the deal would protect more than 100 million households earning less than $250,000 a year from income tax increases that were scheduled to take effect in 2013, according to The Washington Post.   Farm Programs Extended: The budget package also would extend most U.S. farm support programs for a year and end fears that the retail price of milk could double. The extension rankled some farm-state lawmakers who had pushed for an overhaul of dairy support programs as part of a five-year agriculture bill, Bloomberg News reported.   Senate Votes to Raise Taxes on Wealthy: The Senate early on New Year’s Day overwhelmingly approved legislation that would allow tax rates to go up on the wealthiest Americans while putting off, for now, sweeping spending cuts. Voting before dawn on Tuesday, the Senate passed the measure 89-8. Sen. Bernie Sanders voted yes. The bill to avert the so-called fiscal cliff now goes to the House.  Vermonter of the Year: Environmentalist Bill McKibben has been among the most effective voices raising the alarm about the threats of climate change, the Burlington Free Press said in naming and Ripton, Vt., resident its ‘Vermonter of the Year” for 2012.
