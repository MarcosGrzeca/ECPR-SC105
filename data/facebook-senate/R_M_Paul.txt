I am deeply saddened at the passing of Marshall County Judge-Executive Mike Miller. Mike was a dedicated public servant who spent 40 years of his life serving the community he loved as county judge-executive. Mike and I worked well together over the past few years, despite being from different political parties. Kelley and I offer our condolences and prayers to Chyrill and the Miller family.
It has become a Paul Family tradition for all of us to go to Paxx Burk in Bowling Green, #KY to pick out our Christmas Tree. Wishing you and your families a very Merry Christmas! From, The Paul Family

When Congress comes back into session in December, I will introduce a resolution to declare war against ISIS. I believe the President must come to Congress to begin a war and that Congress has a duty to act. Right now, this war is illegal until Congress acts pursuant to the Constitution and authorizes it.

President Obama is not above the law and has no right to issue Executive Amnesty. His actions blatantly ignore the Separations of Powers and the principles our country was founded on. The President has said 22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration. 
 
 I believe that immigration reform is needed, however for true and effective reform, we must first secure the border. I will not sit idly by and let the President bypass Congress and our Constitution.

In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Americans were eager to catch and punish the terrorists who attacked us. I, like most Americans, demanded justice. But one common misconception is that the Patriot Act applies only to foreigners—when in reality, the Patriot Act was instituted precisely to widen the surveillance laws to include U.S. citizens.  As Benjamin Franklin put it, ‘those who trade their liberty for security may wind up with neither.’   Today’s vote to oppose further consideration of the Patriot Act extension proves that we are one step closer to restoring civil liberties in America.  http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1244

Earlier today, I discussed the over militarization of state law enforcement at a HSGAC hearing.   I think many of us are horrified by some of the images that came out of Ferguson. We were horrified to see an unarmed man with his hands over his head being confronted by an armored personnel carrier or by a drawn assault weapon. We're horrified by images of tear gas being shot into the yards of protesters.   One of the fundamental things about America is dissent, and the ability to have dissent.   But confronting protesters with armored personnel is thoroughly un-American and for 150 years, we’ve had rules separating the military, keeping the military out of policing affairs. You obscure that separation if you allow the police to become the military.

Gonzolez said the money was intended to buy a refrigerated truck for a produce business, but the cops figured all that cash must have something to do with illegal drugs. Although there was not much evidence to support that theory, under federal forfeiture law the government managed to keep Gonzolez's money based on little more than a hunch. A bill introduced last week by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., would make that sort of highway robbery harder to pull off."

The federal government has made it far too easy for government agencies to take and profit from the property of those who have not been convicted of a crime. The FAIR Act will ensure that government agencies no longer profit from taking the property of U.S. citizens without due process, while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds of crime.

The interstate highway system is of vital importance to our economy. All across the country, bridges, and roads are deficient and in need of replacement.

Tomorrow we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is simply unimaginable to think what modern America would be like if not for the brave men and women who stood up for the rights of all Americans.   This legislation changed the future of our nation by enforcing the belief that all men and women are created equal. We must continue to build an America that our children-of every race, creed and color-deserve.
Today, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of religious freedom by taking a stand with Hobby Lobby.   Religious liberty will remain intact and all Americans can stay true to their faith without fear of big government intervention or punishment.   Our nation was founded on the principle of freedom, and with this decision, America will continue to serve as a safe haven for those looking to exercise religious liberty.

I’ve read David Barron’s memos concerning the legal justification for killing an American citizen overseas without a trial or legal representation, and I am not satisfied. While the President forbids me from discussing what is in the memos, I can tell you what is not in the memos.   There is no valid legal precedent to justify the killing of an American citizen not engaged in combat. In fact, one can surmise as much because the legal question at hand has never been adjudicated. Therefore, I shall not only oppose the nomination of David Barron, but will filibuster.  http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1158

"The recent announcement of a Fatah-Hamas unity agreement brings both danger and opportunity to the peace process, and the next five weeks may prove critical.  Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with an entity that does not believe it should exist and that has used terrorist tactics to seek its end.  That being said, the new unity government has a chance to put itself on the record as clearly believing in the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, as Israel recognizes the right of a Palestinian state to exist. It should also declare an immediate and lasting ceasefire to enable negotiations.    If that is accomplished swiftly, the peace process can move forward with two willing partners.  In the absence of such a clear, unambiguous statement on the part of the newly unified Palestinian government, the United States should act to enforce the law and cut off aid to the Palestinian government until they recognize Israel's right to exist.  I will introduce a measure when Congress returns this week to make all future aid to the Palestinian government conditional upon this statement, with a cutoff date of five weeks from now if, upon its formation, the new government does not take this vital step toward peace."

Since the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, 55 million abortions have taken place in America. The question remains, can a civilization long endure if it does not respect Life? It is the government's duty to protect life, liberty, and property, but primarily and most importantly, a government must protect Life.  In order to protect the unborn from the very moment Life begins, I introduced the Life at Conception Act. Today, our nation wavers and our moral compass is adrift. Only when America chooses, remembers and restores her respect for life will we re-discover our moral bearings and truly find our way.  http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1080

It is simply unimaginable to think what modern America would be like if not for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s courage and triumph.   Today, we celebrate his life and reflect on his influence and call for ending injustice in America. When one sees an injustice so great, he or she must make a choice-to continue tolerating the injustice or make sacrifices in the name of stopping it. Thankfully for us, Dr. King made sacrifices and chose the path less traveled.   In years to come, we must keep building the kind of America that is worthy of his memory and that our children-of every race, creed and color-deserve.  http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1071

We are blessed to live in a country where individual and religious freedoms, guaranteed through our Constitution, allow us to enjoy Thanksgiving as a celebration of our blessings.  We must also not forget those who have sacrificed to protect those freedoms, and keep our thoughts and prayers with those who are away from their families, serving our nation, over the holidays.  From my family to yours, happy Thanksgiving.

Political leaders such as Mr. Obama and Mrs. Pelosi need to realize that they are not above the American people, and they are not above our laws, period.   If Chief Justice Roberts thinks it is OK for the federal government to tax individuals if they don’t buy expensive private health insurance plans, he should be forced into Obamacare’s government-centered health care system.

We should ascertain who used the weapons and we should have an open debate in Congress over whether the situation warrants U.S. involvement.

Today, we celebrate our Declaration of Independence.   This document and the sentiment that inspired were milestones in our history. Our founding fathers stood up for life and liberty, all the while risking theirs.  If, as Reagan said, "Freedom is never more than a generation away from extinction," will ours be the one to allow the flame to be extinguished?  I don't believe so.   I believe we are prepared to stand and fight to preserve our nation, our rights and our liberty.   On this day, I am thankful for being given the opportunity to play a role in this cause.  And I am grateful for the support you have given to me and to others.    Today, many will be with their families, go to parades, cook out, and celebrate. I will be one of those enjoying this day.  John Adams spoke of our Independence and declared that it, "ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.  It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more"  In Bowling Green, Kentucky today where I am today, there will be fireworks and music, and perhaps there will be speeches that remind us of the origins of the day, and our freedoms.  We should take time to reflect on what that means to us.  To me it means the freedom to live in the manner prescribed and protected in our founding documents.  It means standing up for free speech, even when you disagree with the speech.  It means standing up for the 4th, 5th and 6th amendment, even when it might seem more expeditious not to.  It means removing the obstacles to freedom that are sometimes placed in the path of the individual, the worker or the job creator.    For these rights, this liberty, is what defines us and allows us to prosper.   As Emerson said, "For what avail the plough or sail, or land or life, if freedom fails."  Enjoy the 4th.   Celebrate with family and friends.   And pledge to continue the fight for freedom, so you and I can say we preserved it here for another generation.       In liberty,  Rand Paul
On this 4th, liberty is under assault at home and we continue to side with the enemies of freedom abroad. My Washington Times column.

President Obama today declared a war on coal, and thus declared a war on Kentucky jobs and our economy. Whether it is through the retroactive denial of permits, onerous regulations on coal-fired power plants, or unreasonable environmental requirements, the policies of this Administration are threatening the very way of life that has sustained Kentucky communities for generations.  As a defender of the free market and of coal, I will continue to fight back against the EPA and any other federal agency whose goal is to stifle coal production. I will continue to stand up for our miners in Washington as we continue to recognize the sacrifices they make to provide food for their families and energy for America.  http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=875

American citizens should not be forced to carry around a National Identification Card as a condition of citizenship, because the card offends any reasonable basic concept of freedom.

Much of our foreign aid has no oversight. The waste and fraud that occurs remains classified information. I say we release this information so Americans can have a look at how their government is spending their tax dollars.
On Friday, April 26, I issued a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry requesting that instances of waste, misuse and theft of U.S. foreign aid be investigated and then made public.   Instances of such waste and abuse should be transparent for the American people so that they can judge for themselves whether the benefits of our taxpayer-funded aid is worth the costs.

Read the op-ed I penned today in the Washington Times regarding mandatory minimums.  Judges will tell you that mandatory minimums don’t actually do anything to keep us safer. In fact, judges will tell you that mandatory minimums do much harm to taxpayers and to individuals, who may have their lives ruined for a simple mistake or minor lapse of judgment.  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/5/minimizing-authority-of-judges/
I will be speaking at this event in support of the Freedom to Fish Act, legislation I have co-sponsored that would keep the Army Corps of Engineers from restricting access to the tailwater areas of the Cumberland River.

Writes Jen Rubin: "His actual proposal is quite restricted, however. In fact it is not clear he favors citizenship at all — the word does not appear in his speech. Instead he favors border security to be certified by an inspector general and then ratified by Congress before moving on to available work visas for those here illegally."

The FaceBook generation can detect falseness and hypocrisy a mile away. They are the core of the 'leave me alone' coalition.  They doubt that Social Security will be there for them.    They worry about jobs and money, rent and student loans.  They want leaders that won’t feed them a line of crap or sell them short. They aren't afraid of individual liberty.   My CPAC Speech is happening now. Watch here:http://www.therightscoop.com/watch-live-cpac-2013/

"I will not sit quietly and let President Obama shred the Constitution."  Watch my live filibuster on C-SPAN 2 by clicking the link below: http://www.c-span.org/Live-Video/C-SPAN2/
"The fact that the Obama Administration has told a U.S. Senator that there is a circumstance where the government could target and kill an American citizen on American soil without charge or without trial is a stark example of an imperial presidency. This is what our founding fathers wanted to fight against. "  Watch my live filibuster on C-SPAN by clicking the link below: http://www.c-span.org/Live-Video/C-SPAN2/
Over the next few hours, I will be speaking on the Senate floor to discuss at length my opposition to John Brennan’s nomination to be director of the CIA, as well as my concern over the constitutionality of the use of drone attacks on Americans and on U.S. soil.   I am actively filibustering Mr. Brennan’s nomination until further notice. Tune in on C-SPAN now.
"I dont care whether it is a Democrat or Republican President, this is about authority.  The President should not have the authority to execute American citizens on U.S. soil without a fair trial."  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bufSAqefYM

Today, I introduced an amendment that would strike funding for a Senatorial Office slush fund. In the wake of sequestration, this amendment would save up to $2.8 million over a four year period. It is time for our elected officials to lead by example and stop spending as though we have possession of a credit card that we don’t have to pay for.   View my release and watch my floor speech below: http://paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=723
Last night I appeared on Fox Business' Stossel Show with John Stossel to discuss our government's out of control spending.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocn8G40q8ns
"Our nation has a serious spending problem that must be re-evaluated. Last week I unveiled a plan that would reduce the anticipated layoffs by cutting spending, such as government travel budgets and the rehiring of federal employees. I am encouraged to hear that the White House is adopting these two measures in their assessment of the sequester cuts, but these cuts barely begin to scratch the surface of the problem."  Click below to read my press release in its entirety.  http://paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=720
Introduced the REINS Act today, which would require Congress to approve every new major rule proposed by the President, before it can be enforced on the American People.  http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=719
"I wish the sequester was about actually cutting spending.  Instead, it's belly aching about slowing down the rate of growth in spending."   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGizerBkFQg

School choice is the solution to problems with our education system. I believe equality in education will only be achieved when we allow school choice for all: rich or poor, white, brown or black.
The Republican Party's history is rich and chock full of black history and the fight for civil liberties. I believe in a Republican Party that never shrinks from the idea that minorities — whether determined by the color of your skin or shade of your ideology — should warrant equal protection.
Today I introduced the Sequester Alternative Plan: The Sequester Without Layoffs  http://paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=716
"The sequester was President Obama's idea--- he signed it into law.  He needs to take responsibility for it and act responsibly."   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tAC9IofKp8
I issued my final letter to Brennan questioning whether or not this Administration believes it has the authority to carry out drone strikes in the U.S.  If this letter goes unanswered, I intend to filibuster his nomination as Director of the CIA.  Click below to read the full text of the letter, sent on Wednesday, Feb. 20, to Mr. Brennan.  http://paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=713
Today I announced that I will be returning $600,000 to the United States Treasury – money unspent from my official operating budget.   This budget is the only budget I can control, and since taking office I have returned $1.1 million to the U.S. Treasury.   http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=712

I’ll be paying close attention to the President’s State of the Union Address and offering the official Tea Party response afterward. You can watch my response live here: http://static.teapartyexpress.org/
"If Congress refuses to obey its own rules, if Congress refuses to pass a budget, if Congress refuses to read the bills, then I say: Sweep the place clean. Limit their terms and send them home!"  To hear the rest of my Tea Party response to the President's State of the Union Address, tune in here around 10:30 p.m. ET: www.teapartyexpress.org
"Washington acts in a way that your family never could – they spend money they do not have, they borrow from future generations, and then they blame each other for never fixing the problem."
"Not only should the sequester stand, many pundits say the sequester really needs to be at least $4 trillion to avoid another downgrade of America's credit rating. Both parties will have to agree to cut, or we will never fix our fiscal mess"
More from the Tea Party response I will be giving at 10:30 p.m. ET:  "Both parties have been guilty of spending too much, of protecting their sacred cows, of backroom deals in which everyone up here wins, but every taxpayer loses. It is time for a new bipartisan consensus. It is time Democrats admit that not every dollar spent on domestic programs is sacred. And it is time Republicans realize that military spending is not immune to waste and fraud."
An excerpt from tonight's Tea Party response to the State of the Union:   "We are the party that embraces hard work and ingenuity, therefore we must be the party that embraces the immigrant who wants to come to America for a better future. We must be the party who sees immigrants as assets, not liabilities. We must be the party that says, 'If you want to work, if you want to become an American, we welcome you."
Tonight I will be delivering the Tea Party response to the President's State of the Union Address. You can watch it live online here around 10:30 p.m. ET: www.teapartyexpress.org

Congratulations to the University of Louisville football program -- Coach Charlie Strong, his staff and, most of all, the student-athletes. They should be very proud of their achievements this season, which culminated in last night's Sugar Bowl victory.
On today's early-morning fiscal cliff vote in the Senate: "Americans began ringing in the new year moments ago, many with the uncertainty of their financial stability as a result of the fiscal cliff negotiations we have heard so much about over the past weeks.   "While I appreciate my colleagues’ efforts to protect taxpayers – I don’t think the deal we reached tonight went far enough in achieving that. The combination of raising taxes and increasing spending is not in Americans’ best interest, and I could not, in good faith, support this piece of legislation.   "I will continue my fight for the American taxpayers and small businesses in the 113th Congress."
