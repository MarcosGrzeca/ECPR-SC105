While I support funding the government, as well as several conservative priorities and provisions important to Alabama in the omnibus, I opposed the overall bill.   The omnibus fails to properly address President Obama’s action to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants through executive fiat.  I remain firmly opposed to providing amnesty to those who have broken our laws and I stand ready to fight against the President’s executive overreach when Republicans control both the House and the Senate next Congress.

My reaction to today's news that top officials at the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System have been removed from their positions:  "When I met with Secretary Robert McDonald last month prior to his confirmation, he assured me that he would act expeditiously to address my and Congresswoman Martha Roby’s concerns about the inexcusable mismanagement of the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System.  His action today in replacing the two top officials in Montgomery who presided over such mistreatment is a promising sign that he is serious about addressing the many problems at the VA across the country, and particularly in Montgomery.  This is only the first step in a difficult journey to improve care for our veterans, but it is an important one and I welcome it."

These regulations are the face of executive overreach, and we pledge to continue to fight against them.

Senator Shelby- "I make a conscious effort to spend only what is necessary to best serve my constituents." 
AL Delegation Disaster Support Letter to President Obama:  April 30, 2014  President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. Washington, DC 20500  Dear Mr. President:   On behalf of the State of Alabama, we are writing to support Governor Robert Bentley’s request for an emergency declaration pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act as a result of the severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flash flooding that affected Alabama on April 28, and 29, 2014.   Governor Bentley has declared a state of emergency under Alabama law, and state and local officials are coordinating with the response and cleanup.  Governor Bentley has requested debris removal and emergency protective measures (Categories A and B), including direct federal assistance under the Public Assistance program statewide.  The Governor has further requested a 100 percent federal cost share for the first 72 hours.    These storms have caused widespread power losses that have negatively impacted residents, businesses, schools, and state and local government operations.  Damage assessments are far from complete, but initial reports suggest significant injury to communities across the State.  We therefore urge you to approve Governor Bentley’s request expeditiously.    The Alabama Emergency Management Agency has been working closely and effectively with the Federal Emergency Management Agency since the beginning of this incident, and we are grateful for their combined efforts in responding to the affected communities’ needs.  We thank you for your prompt attention to this request.  Our offices stand ready to provide you with any additional information that you require.
