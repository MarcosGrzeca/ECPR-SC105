Sen. Johnson appeared tonight on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File to discuss President Obama’s immigration executive action and his plans to respond as incoming chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee - watch here:
Sen. Johnson will appear on The Kelly File tonight at 8 p.m. CT on Fox News. Sen. Johnson will discuss President Obama’s #immigration #executiveaction and how he plans to respond as the incoming chairman of Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the new congress.
Issuing an executive order on #immigration and picking a fight with the next Congress is not the way to begin a new relationship.  Ignoring the will of the people who voted against his policies just a couple of weeks ago, the president has chosen to engage in action that he himself has repeatedly said he does not have the authority to do.  Regardless of the president's actions, I will not be deterred in pursuing my top priority as incoming chairman of the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee: passing a strong and effective border security and enforcement bill. -rj
Today, Sen. Johnson spoke at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and asked why the United States is not taking certain measures to stop the spread of #ebola.
I was pleased that Senate Democrats finally agreed  to hold a vote regarding the #KeystoneXL Pipeline this evening, and I was happy to vote yes. However, I am disappointed this important piece of legislation failed to pass by one vote.  Democrats’ failure to support this legislation is a prime example of the dysfunction in Washington and how their policies have hurt our economy. -rj   Read my full statement here: http://1.usa.gov/1qno40d

My daughter, Carey, gave me this picture on her wedding day last year in a frame etched with the following sentiment: ‘I’ve loved you since my heart was the size of a plum.’ For those of you who don't know Carey's story, she was born with a serious heart defect and was treated by wonderful health care professionals who saved her life by performing medical miracles during her first year of life.  Those doctors could do their life-saving work, and Carey’s mother, Jane, and I could access that care because we had the freedom to seek out the most advanced treatments.  We need to preserve that freedom and what is best within our health care system. – rj #TBT

Senator Johnson talking to students at Nicolet High School in Glendale.
We hear people say that Republicans want to slash government recklessly. It’s just not true. The debate is about whether government spending will grow a lot or in a more restrained way. The federal government spent $3.5 trillion last year. See the difference between the red and blue bars? That’s the difference between the Obama budget and Paul Ryan’s “draconian” cuts: Whether we’ll increase spending to $5.9 trillion or restrain the increase to $5 trillion.

Senator Johnson meeting with constituents in Washington.
The size and scope of the federal government has grown incredibly. A century ago, federal spending made up about 2 percent of the economy. Now? It’s 20 percent. It’s heading up for 30% by 2035, according to the Congressional Budget Office. When you add state and local government spending on top of that, government will consume about 45 percent of our economy’s output.

Letting the Senate debate the reinstatement of extended benefits will give Harry Reid and his Senate Democrats a chance to prove they are serious about setting priorities in spending.  If they don't want to simply play politics with the unemployment extension issue, they will find lower priority spending to eliminate over the same period as any extension they propose.  They will also enact reforms and provide guidance as to when ‘temporary and emergency’ federal unemployment insurance will end and this function can be wholly turned back over to states, where it should properly reside. -rj

I'm getting a lot of questions about the Senate debate on gun violence. I was proud to cosponsor an amendment introduced by Judiciary Committee Ranking Republican Grassley, which earned bipartisan support in the Senate vote yesterday. It cracks down on attempts by felons to illegally purchase firearms, increases penalties for gun trafficking, requires the Department of Justice to explain its failure to prosecute gun cases, and improves the existing Criminal Background Check System. This amendment was supported by 52 Senators - a majority - but failed to pass under Senate rules.  I opposed the President's bill, which was fatally flawed. But I will continue to support efforts to deter and punish violent crime, and keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally unstable.

Lots of folks are asking about last week's Senate vote on the Market Fairness Act. Right now thousands of hard-working small business owners compete at an unfair disadvantage against their bigger competitors. Brick and mortar stores are forced to collect sales taxes that their larger online competitors do not.
