Two years ago, Princess Kayla and her family came to Washington from Delaware to urge Congress to pass the ABLE Act and help the families of young people with disabilities save for their long-term care. Yesterday, we succeeded!
“Our bipartisan bill will ensure the federal government does everything it can to build a foundation for manufacturing job growth in Delaware and across the country,” Coons added. “Its passage is great news for our workers and our businesses, and I look forward to continue working hard, on a bipartisan basis, for good manufacturing job creation.”
“This bill is about fixing a mistake that would have cost more than 500 Delaware jobs.”
"I believe the American people deserve — and our values demand — exactly this sort of a robust and open debate. I think that Congress should not adjourn until we vote on an AUMF."
“We cannot continue to wait for House Republicans to act while some of our most pressing challenges go unmet. Although I wish it were not necessary, the President is acting within his legal authority. It is my hope that in the new Congress, House Republicans will come to the table to finish this crucial work.”
Americans expect and deserve a government that can keep our nation safe without compromising our privacy.
The president should guarantee that all U.S. citizens who travel to West Africa to help fight Ebola will be allowed to return to the United States, that any medical care they need as a result of their trip will be provided free of charge and that wages lost to any government-imposed quarantine will be reimbursed. That’s the least we can do for the volunteers, missionaries and military personnel working to end this outbreak.

Matt Haley was one of the most remarkable people I’ve ever met. He was so much more than a talented chef and celebrated restaurateur — he was such a good man. He was a great Delawarean. He was a friend. His death is heartbreaking.  Matt got a second chance at life and vowed to seize it. He was a reminder to all of us that we should embrace life and live it fully and graciously and gratefully every single day. His spirit, enthusiasm, and creativity were infectious. He endlessly sought and found opportunities to make a difference in people’s lives. He didn’t seek attention for his good works, but he certainly deserved it.   The weekend before Matt left for India, I met a woman in Dover – a recovering addict who couldn’t find work because she couldn’t find anyone willing to take a chance on her and to believe in her. I told her Matt’s story and the incredible life he’d made after the mistakes of his youth. I called Matt the next day and he leapt at the opportunity to help her. He took her number and promised to call her right away because he was getting on a plane the next morning. He told me about the trip and the risks involved. He couldn’t wait to see his dear friends in Nepal, and he was excited to fulfill a promise he had made to a friend in the region. Matt was going there on a mission to bring what his heart made possible. I told him how proud I was to know him.  I can’t believe he’s gone and I’m so grateful that the last thing we got to do together was to try to help someone. That was Matt. That’s what he did. I’m going to miss his friendship, generosity, and compassion, and his passionate commitment to our community. My heart aches for his family and friends.  - Chris
