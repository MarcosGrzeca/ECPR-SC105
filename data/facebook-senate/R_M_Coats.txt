"Even more fundamentally, the EPA, like every administrative agency, is constitutionally forbidden to exercise powers Congress never delegated to it in the first place. The brute fact is that the Obama administration failed to get climate legislation through Congress. Yet the EPA is acting as though it has the legislative authority anyway to re-engineer the nation’s electric generating system and power grid. It does not."

Since 1961, nine different Republican and Democrat presidents have opposed normalizing relations with Cuba. President Obama’s announcement is further evidence that his foreign policy objective is appeasement. The president’s action rewards the Castro regime at the expense of the Cuban people, who will continue to be denied fair elections, an independent judicial system and free speech rights.
Continued best wishes to the Banks family.
Today I joined a group of senators in a bipartisan letter calling on Secretary of State John Kerry to assist religious minorities facing persecution in Syria and Iraq, such as Christians and Yazidis, to find refuge in the United States.

Tonight the Senate is voting on the nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy to serve as U.S. Surgeon General. It is baffling to me that the Obama Administration would put forward a candidate so wholly unqualified to serve as the nation’s top doctor. Given the wide range of pressing health issues facing our country, the next surgeon general should have substantial experience in the medical field, which Dr. Murthy simply does not have. His history of controversial political activism in support of Obamacare and gun control is troubling. Partisanship and a liberal political agenda is not the prescription for the nation's leading spokesman on matters of public health. I oppose this nomination.
Many Hoosiers have written me with concerns that the omnibus spending bill passed by Congress funds President Obama’s executive amnesty plan. This bill does not fund Obama’s amnesty because funds appropriated by Congress aren’t being used to implement any of what the Obama Administration plans to do. Instead, the administration is going to pay for its plan by using visa fees, which are collected by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This means that once the Obama Administration starts granting amnesty, it will be paid for by fees collected from those trying to legally immigrate to the United States, not funds appropriated by Congress.    What Congress can do to stop President Obama’s amnesty plan is pass a bill prohibiting the use of visa fees to implement the executive action or attach this language as a rider on an appropriations bill. Republicans wanted to attach such a rider to the spending bill Congress just approved, but given that Democrats still control the Senate, it had no chance of passing. This is why Republicans fought to only fund DHS through February 27, 2015. By funding DHS only through February, a Republican House and Senate can attach a rider blocking Obama’s amnesty plan to the next DHS appropriations bill.
One of Congress’ primary duties is to fund the federal government, but under the management of Harry Reid, the Senate has consistently ignored important spending decisions until literally the last minute. This forces senators to vote on large bills that fund the entire government, but inevitably include many items I do not support.  The bill that the House sent to the Senate does, however, make positive changes for Hoosier families. Reforms include cutting the EPA budget by $60 million and the IRS budget by $345 million, prohibiting an EPA regulation opposed by Indiana farmers and blocking any new funding to implement Obamacare. This is all in addition to necessities like funding our national security priorities and giving our troops a pay raise.   Republicans will govern not only more conservatively, but also more responsibly, when we take control of the Senate in January. Passing this bill and only temporarily funding the Department of Homeland Security will give Republicans more leverage to fight when President Obama tries to implement his promised executive amnesty order. But that was not the vote we had tonight. When that fight comes, Congress should not fund the president’s lawless behavior.
Always a pleasure to meet with our lawmakers from the Indiana General Assembly.

Today is Indiana's statehood day. Happy 198th birthday Hoosier state!
Tonight the Senate unanimously passed a resolution introduced by Senator Donnelly and me honoring Hoosier Abdul-Rahman (Peter) Kassig. The measure expresses condolences to Kassig’s family and pays tribute to Kassig’s extraordinary humanitarian work. In addition, the resolution condemns the terrorist acts of ISIS and urges the U.S. and international community to work together to address the threat posed by ISIS and the suffering of innocent civilians impacted by the conflict. It is truly a tragedy that a man who helped so many in need had his life cut short. This Hoosier was a bright light in a dark place of difficulty and suffering.

The hallmark of a free society is open and transparent government, but certain disclosures must be carefully weighed against the potential damage to the national security interests of the United States and the security of the men and women who serve our country overseas. This report contains no recommendations and offers only an unconstructive, partisan account of the last decade’s counterterrorism efforts. It is now time for the Senate Intelligence Committee to move past this long-settled issue and focus on the vitally important national security challenges currently facing our country.

Today President Obama will nominate Dr. Ashton Carter to be the next Secretary of Defense. I welcome that nomination. Should Dr. Carter take over the helm at the Defense Department, it would coincide with an ominous development on a national security issue that he and I have dealt with together in the past. In 2008, we worked on a Bipartisan Policy Center report entitled Meeting the Challenge: U.S. Policy Toward Iranian Nuclear Development. I spoke about Dr. Carter and Iran on the Senate floor last night.
"In fact, it is increasingly clear that the sweeping magnitude of Mr. Obama’s order is unprecedented."
I support this action by Governor Pence because the president’s executive action on immigration well exceeded his Constitutional authority. President Obama’s role is to faithfully execute the law, not alter or ignore it as he sees fit. I am hopeful that the legal challenge filed by Indiana and many other states will be successful.
Our national debt recently surpassed $18,000,000,000,000. That’s more than $56,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. When Republicans take control of the Senate next year, we should seize the moment and finally tackle our debt and deficit problems. Fixing these issues will not be easy or occur overnight, but there are several areas where Republicans can work with President Obama — if he is willing to work with us.

Extending yet again negotiations with Iran over its illegal nuclear programs is confirmation of another foreign policy failure. I have been concerned about the direction of these negotiations since their beginning. President Obama is not only ignoring the clear and present danger posed by Iranian ambitions, he is abetting those ambitions by surrendering key positions first and then pursuing negotiations that confirm our weakness. This is the most significant national security issue of our age, and it is being mishandled in order to secure a ‘legacy’ for President Obama. It is important to reassert a vigorous congressional role before we are burdened with a bad agreement that does little to prevent a nuclear Iran. In the meantime, another extension of the misguided, mishandled negotiations means the Iranians can continue their dangerous nuclear activities, secure additional sanctions relief according to the terms of the interim agreement and buy more time to undermine the international sanctions regime. I will work with my Senate colleagues to break this dangerous cycle.
I thank Chuck Hagel for his service to our nation throughout his career. While I did not support Secretary Hagel for this position, ultimately, the buck stops with the president. It is the president who has failed to communicate a serious national security strategy or set conditions that would have allowed Hagel to succeed at the Pentagon. The lack of substantive experience and expertise within the Obama Administration’s national security team remains of grave concern to me. This administration’s confused and weak responses to the flood of foreign crises we face reveals the president’s own indecisive and vacillating foreign policy views and flawed strategies that put our military and national security in an untenable position. This must change now. I urge the president to conduct a top to bottom review of his entire national security team and find experienced advisers who can give him the substantive guidance he is obviously lacking.
President Obama’s actions to change existing law and grant amnesty via executive order exceed his Constitutional authority, ignore the wishes of the American people and contradict his past assertions that only Congress can set immigration policy.

Yesterday I supported the No Social Security for Nazis Act, legislation that would ensure no individuals who participated in Nazi persecutions are eligible to receive Social Security benefits. The countless lives lost during the Holocaust left scars that still haunt much of Europe and the world. Due to an egregious loophole in current law, some Nazis who had lived in the United States after World War II retained Social Security benefits. It is morally wrong and fiscally irresponsible to allow this loophole to remain, which is why I am supporting legislation to right this wrong. American taxpayers should not be funding benefits for those who perpetuated the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.
President Obama’s role is to faithfully execute the law, not alter or ignore it as he sees fit. If the president changes existing immigration law via executive order, he will exceed his Constitutional authority and ignore the wishes of the American people. Taking this action would be a disservice to everyone who followed the law to legally immigrate to the United States. I am working with my colleagues to explore all options – legislative and legal – to stop the president’s blatant disregard for our nation’s system of checks and balances.
"America is a nation of laws, which means I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law. I don't have a choice about that. That's part of my job. But I can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants. … With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed."

Today, all Hoosiers are appalled by the tragic murder of Peter Kassig, and we mourn with his family and loved ones. Peter heroically served his country in uniform, and we celebrate this Hoosier’s life of sacrifice and benevolent service to others. It is truly a tragedy that a man who sought to help those in need had his life cut short by savage barbarians who terrorize the innocent.  The unspeakable depravities ISIS continues to commit are a blatant distortion of the Muslim faith and a cancer on the civilized world. Defeating this so-called caliphate will be a long and protracted effort that requires a resolute commitment from the United States. We must not let this momentary triumph of evil ultimately prevail.
Utmost tragedy that those like Peter Kassig, who seek to help needy, are treated savagely by barbarians who terrorize the innocent.

On this day in 1986, Hoosiers hit movie theaters across the country. This classic film is based on the 1954 Milan High School state champs.
It is long past time to end the needless delay and build the Keystone Pipeline.
The country delivered a public repudiation of President Obama’s policies in the midterm election. The election results show that the American people want the Obama administration to begin working with Republicans on responsible solutions. In addition to constitutional concerns, changing existing immigration law via executive order will ignore the wishes of the American people. It also will jeopardize the president’s opportunity to work with Republicans in 2015. History has shown that granting legal status with only the promise, not proven results, of border security does not work. A unilateral executive action granting amnesty would be a disservice to everyone who followed the law to legally immigrate to the United States.
For years, Republicans in Congress have urged Majority Leader Harry Reid to allow a vote on the Keystone XL Pipeline. The State Department twice found that there would be no significant environmental impacts if the project is built, yet the Obama Administration continues to delay final approval. I am pleased that some on the other side of the aisle finally have called on Congress to end President Obama’s needless delay on this project. This $5.3 billion, privately-funded, shovel-ready project should have been approved a long time ago.

President Obama continues to pursue policies that will drive up U.S. energy prices, kill American jobs and make our economy less competitive. This agreement doubles down on the administration’s misguided war on coal, threatening the reliability of our electricity grid. More troubling, President Obama continues to use executive action to go around Congress, even though the American people, through their elected representatives, explicitly rejected policies similar to the president’s Climate Action Plan.

To all of our veterans and the family members of those who have worn the uniform, thank you. On this day, we also remember the many Hoosiers currently serving overseas and keep them in our prayers.    In 1987, the USS Stark was struck by an Iraqi missile attack in the Persian Gulf, killing 37 United States sailors and wounding 21 others. During a memorial service for the fallen, President Ronald Reagan paid these heroes a tribute that I believe is applicable to all our veterans. He said:  “Yes, they were ordinary men who did extraordinary things. Yes, they were heroes. And because they were heroes, let us not forget this:   That for all the lovely spring and summer days we will never share with them again, for every Thanksgiving and Christmas that will seem empty without them, there will be other moments, too, moments when we see the light of discovery in young eyes, eyes that see for the first time the world around them and know that sweep of history and wonder, ‘Why is there such a place as America, and how is it that such a precious gift is mine?’  And we can answer them. We can answer them by telling of this day and those that we come to honor here. And it's then we'll see understanding in those young eyes; it is then they will know the same gratitude and pride that we share today, the gratitude and pride Americans feel always for those who suffer and die so that the precious gift of America might always be ours.”
The Internet and mobile technology are important to our lives, economy and ability to share information. Rather than encourage this vital and growing economic sector, President Obama’s proposal will stifle innovation and flies in the face of repeated legal decisions. Using an 80-year old law to regulate the Internet as a utility is the wrong approach, and I urge the FCC to reject the president’s proposal.
Happy 239th Birthday to our U.S. Marine Corps. Semper Fi.   "Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world. But the Marines don't have that problem." - President Ronald Reagan, 1985.

Given the increasing risk of terrorist attacks within the United States, these changes are appropriate and a good first step. A full reassessment of cooperative travel agreements, entry procedures and our border security remains necessary to ensure protection of our homeland. I will continue to push my legislation that would examine the Visa Waiver Program and also provide additional tools to address Americans who have joined ISIS and other terror groups.
Israel has long been one of our country’s closest allies, and we believe that attacks of a personal nature on its current head of state are wholly inappropriate, unacceptable and disgraceful.
In less than a month, the results of long negotiations with Iran over its dangerous nuclear program likely will be announced. At that time, the United States and Israel must stand together, as sustainable support for any agreement will require a united front. A strong response to failed negotiations or faulty results also will require a consensus between our countries. An enormous amount is at stake for both the United States and Israel. Now is not the time for snarky name calling between allies, and anonymity only makes it worse. As a former ambassador, I have managed disagreements between allies. Frank exchanges can become fraught, but they should not erupt publicly, and they should never descend to the personal. This attack on an important foreign leader damages our efforts in a critical region at a critical time. The administration needs to start focusing on goals and how to get there.

As Americans, we are blessed to live in a nation with world-class hospitals, medical professionals and technologies designed to deal with complex health care challenges. The outbreak of the Ebola virus is a serious health issue for our country, and the United States needs to aggressively prepare to respond to the threat Ebola poses.   Given the seriousness of this situation, the United States should temporarily enact a visa ban on nationals from Ebola-affected countries. Ensuring that citizens from these countries cannot enter the United States is a common-sense step to contain this virus and protect American citizens.

The same White House that said al-Qaeda was decimated is now trying to blame the intelligence community for its own policy failures in Syria and Iraq.

Tonight I voted in favor of a continuing resolution that funds the federal government until December 11, 2014, and authorizes the arming and training of Syrian rebels to fight ISIS.  It is a disservice to the American people that the Senate did not individually vote on the items included in this resolution. Several significant proposals – including funding for the federal government and authorizing President Obama to train moderate rebels in Syria – should have been debated and voted on separately.   The president recently defined the threat ISIS poses to the United States, and he laid out the goal of defeating and dismantling these extremists. I support him in this effort, but going forward the president must lay out a much better strategy for defeating ISIS. Training a few thousand Syrian rebels is not an adequate response to the challenge America faces. This resolution only gives the administration authority through December 11, and without great clarity from the president over the next ten weeks, I am reluctant to offer further support.

The president’s speech was a sharp, welcome reversal to his previous comments on foreign policy. He has finally grasped the true nature of the threat that ISIL poses, and his response to begin the process of taking down this so-called caliphate is welcome news.   The president incorporated in his speech many of the elements I have called for and that are necessary to achieve success. One is pursuing ISIL forces wherever they are, rather than his previous policy of using force only in Iraq. Also, the president’s call for coalition building is essential, but it is critical that moderate Muslim states play a significant role in this effort.   The president’s plan seemed to limit ground forces to the Iraqi Army and Syrian Free Army, both of which have not shown that they can match up to ISIL. The key here is to be resolute in doing what is necessary to defeat ISIL. The president’s reference to using the same strategy we are using in Yemen and Somalia must be put in the context of the limited success we are having in these countries.   The American people need to understand that if we are to be successful, we are in for a long and protracted effort that will require a resolute commitment from the United States. The region and the world are looking to America and to President Obama for leadership.

On Friday, the Obama Administration announced new modifications to its rule under the Affordable Care Act requiring church-affiliated organizations, charities, hospitals and educational institutions to facilitate access to contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs despite moral objections.  Upon initial review of these changes, I am disappointed that the administration continues to disregard the importance of religious freedom to faith-based organizations. The proposal announced by the administration does not make any significant changes to the previous "accommodation" and will still force faith-based groups to facilitate provision of services in violation of their religious beliefs.   Religious freedom remains under attack across our country, and a gimmick designed to skirt the heart of the issue will not resolve the issue.

There must be worldwide outrage at ISIL’s actions and how innocent civilians are being attacked, tortured and murdered by this so-called caliphate.  ISIL’s actions are a gross perversion of the Islamic faith, and it is time for the millions of Muslims who believe and adhere to the Quran and value human life to respond. Political, religious and other leaders must speak up publicly in opposition to ISIL. They must take a stand and show that they will not tolerate this blatant distortion of their beliefs.   It also is time for the United States, Europe and other nations to recognize that the civilized world is dealing with nothing short of barbarism that cannot be resolved through inaction or diplomacy.

This situation on our southern border is only going to grow worse with time and as the weather cools. Congress needs to address the policies that created this situation, which will send a message to the drug smugglers and coyotes who are spreading false hope to the families sending their children to the United States. The best way to stop this humanitarian crisis is to reunite children who have come to America with their families in their home countries. President Obama and his administration must fully enforce our immigration laws.  Legislation passed by the House of Representatives on Friday takes the right approach to addressing the problem. The House-passed bill would help stem the tide of children making the difficult journey to the United States. Rather than reject the House effort, Senator Reid needs to allow it to be debated in the Senate.

In a 91 to 3 vote, the Senate just passed bipartisan legislation that will implement key changes to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. A compromise between bills previously passed by the House and Senate, the legislation will allow veterans to seek private care if VA doctors are unable to treat patients within 30 days or if veterans live more than 40 miles away from a VA facility.  The legislation also includes a number of provisions that will provide needed reforms to the VA health care system. Increasing accountability and providing veterans facing unacceptable waits for VA medical care with the option to receive private-sector treatment are positive steps. I am hopeful that President Obama will swiftly sign it into law.  Earlier this week, I voted to confirm Bob McDonald, a Gary, Indiana native and former Chief Executive Officer of Procter & Gamble, to serve as the next secretary of the VA. Passing this legislation and confirming a new VA secretary marks a turning point and a chance for a fresh start. We need to keep the promises our country has made to its veterans.
Tonight I voted against the Senate majority’s $3.57 billion supplemental appropriations bill to address the crisis on the southern border of the United States.  The wrong solution to our border crisis is to throw money at the problem without addressing the policies that created this situation. This proposal will fail to stem the tide of children making the dangerous trek to the United States. The best way to stop this humanitarian crisis is to reunite children who have come to America with their families in their home countries. Taking this action will send a message and deter children from even starting the difficult journey to the United States.  I support an alternative proposal - the Protecting Children and America’s Homeland Act - that would make several changes to current immigration law to allow quicker repatriation of unaccompanied alien children while ensuring due process for asylum claims. The bill also would prevent the president from any expansion of the deferred action program and provide funding for border security, law enforcement and humanitarian assistance activities. The cost of the legislation would be fully offset.  This proposal is a reasonable approach that will address this problem more effectively than the classic Washington response of spending money in hopes of fixing a problem. I am disappointed that Harry Reid, once again, refused to allow consideration of any Republican ideas.

Today I introduced legislation that would allow groups seeking 501(c)(4) status or other tax-exempt status to take the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to Tax Court if the IRS fails to act on an application for more than nine months.   This legislation will provide a much-needed avenue of relief for nonprofits whose applications for tax-exempt status are languishing at the IRS. With the IRS approval times of up to three years or more, it is no surprise that the American people continue to distrust the IRS. This bill would give groups the same tools as charities while applying for tax-exempt status. American taxpayers deserve the full truth of what happened at the IRS with its recent targeting of certain organizations, as well as the assurance that these abuses will never happen again.

The latest Social Security and Medicare Trustees report, released this afternoon, shows that Washington continues to ignore our nation’s long-term fiscal challenges.   In their report, the trustees estimate that Social Security's disability trust fund will become insolvent in 2016. Both portions of the Social Security program – disability and old age and survivors benefits – are estimated to become insolvent in 2033, with the Medicare trust fund for hospital coverage projected to be insolvent by 2030.  According to the report, “Neither Medicare nor Social Security can sustain projected long-run program costs in full under currently scheduled financing, and legislative changes are necessary to avoid disruptive consequences for beneficiaries and taxpayers. If lawmakers take action sooner rather than later, more options and more time will be available to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare. Earlier action will also help elected officials minimize adverse impacts on vulnerable populations, including lower-income workers and people already dependent on program benefits.”  Sooner or later, all Americans will feel the impact of our country’s financial reality, and they will hold their elected officials accountable. This report shows why Congress should not wait for this preventable fiscal crisis to hit. We should address this situation now so we are not forced to make more drastic and painful changes later.
The humanitarian and economic impact of our nation’s immigration policy is felt across the country.

This Fourth of July, as we gather with our friends, neighbors and families to commemorate the birth of our nation, we have much to celebrate and many reasons for gratitude.   In a letter to his wife the day before the Declaration of Independence was formally adopted, John Adams wrote, “I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and support and defend these states. Yet through all the gloom I see the rays of ravishing light and glory. I can see that the end is worth all the means. This is our day of deliverance.”  As Adams knew well, our Founding Fathers risked much to fight for our independence, and today we live in a country where freedom is protected and liberty is enshrined in our laws.   Subsequent generations of courageous men and women have risked their lives and worn the uniform of the United States to preserve our great republic.  This weekend we celebrate our country’s heritage and heroes. We also commemorate the 200th anniversary of our national anthem and the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to pen the words of “The Star Spangled Banner.”  The American flag has accompanied our armed forces into battle since the Revolutionary War. It has been draped over the coffins of heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice.   Old Glory has been present at the liberation of oppressed peoples and stitched on the uniforms of those delivering life-saving aid. This flag is known around the world as a symbol of hope. It even flies on the moon.   When I look at our flag, it reminds me of the sacrifices made by brave men and women throughout the history of our country – sacrifices that have saved and preserved our freedoms. It also calls each of us to commit to doing all we can to pass on the blessings of liberty to future generations.   I hope you enjoy time with your family and friends this weekend and celebrate “the land of the free and the home of the brave.”

Freedom of religion is a core American principle guaranteed by the First Amendment, and today the Supreme Court affirmed that this administration cannot pick and choose when to adhere to the Constitution. Employers like Hobby Lobby should not be forced to take actions contrary to their moral and religious beliefs. While I celebrate today’s ruling, religious freedom remains under attack across our country. Whether it is faith-based Hoosier food banks and homeless shelters or the University of Notre Dame, we are seeing the free exercise of religion constrained and restricted in too many instances. I will continue to stand up for these fundamental rights.

Today, the Supreme Court restored a measure of balance to our system by unanimously ruling that the president’s attempts to make recess appointments while the Senate was in session were unconstitutional, and I applaud the decision. The Founders defined the powers of the president in Article II of the Constitution and set a clear limitation on his authority to make appointments, stipulating that he must obtain the "advice and consent of the Senate." This check on executive power is essential to maintaining the integrity of our republic. As a former senator and lecturer on constitutional law, this president should have known better. President Obama has frequently boasted of his intention to bypass Congress on a range of issues, and I hope this unanimous rebuke will cause him to reflect on what it means to exercise executive authority with respect for the elected representatives of the American people.

The newly released GDP numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis revealed economic output in the United States declined by 2.9% during the first three months of 2014. These disappointing numbers only confirm the ongoing struggles many American families are experiencing in this stagnant economy. This staggering GDP loss makes the White House’s 3.4% growth projection for this year nearly impossible to achieve.  The policies pursued by the Obama Administration have failed to bring the jobs and growth our country needs. Given today’s news, how much more evidence do we need that it is time for new ideas? The choice is clear: we can accept lackluster GDP growth and above-average unemployment as the new normal or change course and get our economy growing again.

Congratulations to Fort Wayne broadcasting legend Bob Chase 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is claiming that the agency lost the e-mails of Lois Lerner, the former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Unit, and six of her IRS subordinates. By law, the IRS is required to archive these emails.  In 2010, under the direction of Lerner, the IRS targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny when applying for a tax-exempt status. A huge trust deficit exists between the American people and Washington, and there is no better example of why than the ongoing scandal at the IRS.   To claim that two years of emails were completely and inadvertently lost is laughable on its face and potentially criminal. The IRS’s original actions to target groups based on political viewpoints were outrageous and disgraceful. To refuse to answer questions and provide evidence about the IRS’s illegal actions is a despicable abuse of power and a direct assault on our Constitution.

Too many bureaucrats view our veterans as a list of numbers, rather than heroes worthy of our best care.

Given the horrific reports about inexcusable delays and mismanagement at many VA facilities, we need to give veterans the choice of where to seek health care. Our country has a duty to ensure every one of these heroes receive the best health care our country can offer. This bill is one way we can start to earn back the trust of our veterans.  Today I supported the Veterans Choice Act – legislation to give veterans more options for where to receive care. Among many reforms to the existing VA system, the Veterans Choice Act would:  • Allow veterans to receive care from the doctor or provider of their choice if the VA cannot schedule an appointment for a veteran within their wait time performance metrics or if the veteran resides more than 40 miles from any VA medical center. • Enable all veterans enrolled for care at a VA facility to receive a choice card allowing them to receive care from a non-VA medical provider. • Direct the VA to report to the Department of Health and Human Services the same patient quality and outcome information as other non-VA hospitals. • Require the VA to establish disciplinary procedures should an employee knowingly falsify data pertaining to wait times and quality measures.

Today the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it is proposing new rules on fossil fuel power plants. Yet again, President Obama is trying to circumvent Congress to implement policies that the elected representatives of the American people have rejected. The EPA’s proposed rules amount to a backdoor energy tax that will damage Indiana’s economy and hike electric bills for all Hoosiers. To date, the utility industry has spent tens of billions in capital investment for air pollution controls resulting in significant declines in emissions. Our state is highly reliant on coal power plants, which provide Hoosiers with good jobs and some of the most affordable, reliable electricity in the nation. By supporting these regulations, the president is putting our economic well-being, grid reliability and American jobs at risk.

Patient backlogs, mismanagement and unreasonable delays for reviews of disability claims are evidence that the VA health and benefits system is broken. This resignation, by itself, fixes nothing. This issue requires more than a change in management. I fully support continued investigations to make sure we identify and hold responsible those who have falsified records and neglected patient care. The culture of the VA must change, and we need to look at solutions outside of government-run facilities. My focus remains on ensuring Hoosier veterans receive the care they not only earned, but deserve.

“It's important to understand how much Mr. Reid's tactics have changed the Senate. Not too long ago it was understood that any Senator could get a floor vote if he wanted it. The minority party, often Democrats, used this right of amendment to sponsor votes that would sometimes put the majority on the spot. It's called politics, rightly understood. This meant the Senate debated national priorities and worked its bipartisan will. Harry Reid's Senate has become a deliberate obstacle to democratic accountability.”

As a veteran, I firmly believe our country has a duty to honor and support those who have sacrificed to protect and defend our country. Some issues must rise above politics and the care of our veterans tops the list. The reports out of Phoenix and other VA facilities are shocking, outrageous and completely unacceptable. Once all the facts are gathered, sweeping changes must be made at this agency. Right now, the credibility of the entire VA health and benefits system is on the line. Along with addressing allegations of abuse, the excessive delays at VA facilities, including those faced by many Hoosiers, must be eliminated. While resignations from top leadership may be necessary, the real problem facing the VA is a culture of mismanagement and indifference to the needs of veterans. The VA must refocus and reorganize to ensure that America’s veterans are receiving the care and support they deserve.

In its ruling yesterday in Town of Greece v. Galloway, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of Americans to pray in the public square, including legislative prayer.  The chaplain of the United States Senate opens each legislative day with a prayer, usually appealing for wisdom and clarity. I think we all agree that Washington needs more of both, and this long-standing tradition of opening in prayer traces back to America’s earliest days.  I agree with Justice Kennedy, who said that the tradition of public prayer exists to unite, not divide. As a nation that cherishes the First Amendment, we must not sacrifice the Constitutional right to practice faith in the public square in the name of political correctness. Religious liberty is a core American principle, and efforts to constrain and restrict the exercise of religion and freedom of speech must be opposed.

Last night I was part of a group that met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine. Our discussion with Chancellor Merkel was both substantive and productive, and I believe she is a strong leader who is best positioned to be the voice of Europe. The chancellor and I agree that diplomacy alone will not move Vladimir Putin and diplomatic efforts to date have not been effective.  The most effective response to the Ukraine crisis is for the United States and Europe to speak with one voice on both diplomacy and sanctions. For this approach to be successful, both President Obama and Chancellor Merkel have to be willing to look at tougher measures. We need to send a strong message that we are not going to be pushed around by a bully from Russia.  Earlier this week, I joined with my Senate colleagues to offer a new legislative package that addresses Russian aggression, including the strengthening of NATO and tough diplomatic and economic sanctions. I am hopeful that President Obama will consider this proposal.  In the long-term, the United States must help Europe break its dependence on Russian energy sources. As the chancellor mentioned, the U.S. can take a role in this, given recent oil and natural gas discoveries in our country. President Obama also can send a strong signal to Europe by approving the Keystone Pipeline and demonstrating that we are committed to increasing domestic energy production. Despite bipartisan support for this project in Congress, its construction will not happen without the president’s support.
NA
The Keystone pipeline has bipartisan support in Congress because it will provide American jobs and reduce our country’s dependence on foreign oil. This project has been sitting on the president’s desk awaiting his signature for five years, and it is long past time for him to get on board in support of this proposal.
Yesterday John Graham, the Dean of Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs, testified before a Joint Economic Committee hearing about ways to cut government red tape.

I look forward to continuing discussions about how we can find ways to reduce the unnecessary burden regulations are placing on Hoosiers.

Today I joined with a group of 20 senators, including Senators Bob Corker, John McCain, Marco Rubio, and Lindsey Graham, to introduce the Russian Aggression Prevention Act, new legislation that would provide a strategic U.S. response to recent Russian aggression in Europe. Our bill contains specific provisions I sought, including sanctions on Russia’s Rosoboronexport, the sole state agency for export of Russian weapons systems and defense-related goods, and non-recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea.  The lack of a forceful, effective response by the administration and Western leaders has given Putin little reason to expect that further aggression will be punished. We are introducing tough diplomatic, economic and financial sanctions, and I am hopeful that President Obama will support our effort. If he is willing to lead by taking action that demonstrates American disapproval of Russia’s aggression, I am confident that a bipartisan majority in Congress will stand with him.
Today I voted against moving forward on legislation to increase the federal minimum wage.  In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office informed Congress that an increase in the minimum wage would result in the loss of up to one million American jobs. The Employment Policy Institute also recently estimated that in Indiana there could be up to 27,800 fewer jobs created if the Senate proposal is enacted.   Helping Hoosiers and Americans struggling to make ends meet is not a political issue but a goal shared by every senator. Both Republicans and Democrats are concerned about our fellow citizens who live in poverty, those who are unemployed and the lack of opportunities in many of America’s rural communities and inner cities. If our purpose is to increase the wages of all Americans, I believe there are better ways to accomplish this goal.  While some claim this legislation will merely add a few cents to the price of a burger, its actual cost will be far greater. Raising the minimum wage creates winners and losers – it will raise the wages of some but result in job losses for many low-income workers. The true problem plaguing impoverished Americans is not low wage rates but a lack of good job opportunities. Raising the minimum wage will fail to alleviate poverty because it will fail to address unemployed or underemployed American workers.

While I am encouraged that President Obama has announced more sanctions, I continue to be concerned that the administration’s actions are too little, too late to effectively deter Putin. To date, the lack of a forceful, effective response by the administration and Western leaders has given this bully on the playground little reason to expect that further aggression will be punished. The president must use today’s announcement to pave the way for additional sanctions. I am working with my Senate colleagues on a series of tough diplomatic, economic and financial sanctions, and I am hopeful that President Obama will support our effort. If he is willing to lead by taking action that demonstrates American disapproval of Russia’s actions, I am confident that a bipartisan majority in Congress will stand with him in support.

Anyone who has ever raised a child, held a newborn baby or witnessed the miracle of birth knows that life is a sacred and precious gift that must be protected.

I have repeatedly called for sanctions against Russia in response to continued illegal Russian aggression in Ukraine. One specific immediate action the U.S. and international community can take is to halt all defense contracts with Russia. I joined 10 of my Republican and Democrat colleagues to urge Secretary of State John Kerry to ask our allies to do this.     http://www.coats.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/coats-members-ask-kerry-to-urge-for-end-of-russian-defense-contracts- 
Given that the federal tax code contains 70,000 pages of complex rules, it is hardly surprising that 90 percent of taxpayers throw up their hands and turn to a paid preparer or computer software to complete their taxes. Across the country, Americans spend over $165 billion and about six billion hours annually on tax compliance.   Despite positive steps taken by our state in recent years, Hoosiers still spend too much time and money navigating our broken tax system to complete their taxes. Our tax code is in desperate need of reform, and one of my top legislative priorities remains making our tax system simpler, fairer and more competitive. Comprehensive tax reform now will result in more jobs and economic growth in the future.  While there is a bipartisan consensus in Congress that reform is needed, the current political climate rewards the status quo. I will continue to make the case in Washington that one of the best ways to grow our economy and strengthen America’s place in the global marketplace is to make tax reform a reality.

In addition to previous measures I have brought before the Senate, today I am introducing the Crimea Annexation Non-Recognition Act, which would ensure that the United States does not recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea nor take any action that would imply such recognition.

I support helping those truly in need, but the unemployment insurance benefits program needs to be reformed to ensure that it works better and is connecting those who are unemployed with available jobs. Since the debate on extending these benefits began, I said that any extension must be paid for and include measures to reform the program. I offered several amendments to achieve these goals, but my proposals were rejected by the Majority Leader. Because this legislation is not responsibly paid for and does not include reforms this program needs, I cannot support an extension of benefits.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqatKpgNJjM&list=UUipTNiqJBYHutxpMxo0UOYw

A day later, I am still celebrating the good news announced by GE Aviation
It was great to meet with St. Louis Catholic School students of Batesville this afternoon in the Capitol
Today’s announcement is great news for Lafayette and the entire state. This facility will significantly contribute to the Hoosier economy and bring high-paying jobs to Tippecanoe County. I am thrilled that GE Aviation – a company that has and continues to be a leader in technological innovation – has put its faith in Indiana’s future and our highly-skilled workforce.
I stand with Hobby Lobby and similar organizations affected by the Obama administration’s mandate. Freedom of religion is a core American principle, and we cannot pick and choose when to adhere to the Constitution and when to cast it aside in order to achieve political prerogatives. I hope the Supreme Court will strike down the administration’s mandate and rescind this attack on religious freedom.
It is clear that two things do not matter to President Obama – deadlines and red lines. Whether it is health care or foreign policy, this administration continues to show a lack of resolve that is baffling. The latest Obamacare delay is just further evidence of why individuals should receive the same exemption the administration already has given to businesses. All Americans deserve the same protection from this law’s mandates.  The goal of policymakers – Republican and Democrat – should be making health care more affordable and increasing access to quality care. Obamacare has failed to meet this goal, and it should be a priority of Congress to protect all Americans from a law that is failing to live up to its promises. I am working with my Senate colleagues to push for alternative solutions to replace the failing parts of Obamacare with real reforms that would benefit Hoosier families.

Today I introduced an amendment to the Ukrainian aid bill currently under consideration in the Senate that would sanction Russia’s Rosoboronexport, the sole state agency for export of Russian weapons systems and defense-related goods. Rosoboronexport is exclusively entitled to export the entire range of Russian armaments officially available for export, and it has supplied arms to the Assad regime in Syria, enabling mass atrocities.  My amendment would do three things:  • Prohibit the United States government from doing any business with Rosoboronexport and terminate any existing contracts or agreements; • Prohibit contracts with any domestic or foreign company that cooperates with Rosoboronextort to design, manufacture or sell military equipment; and • Authorize the President to deduct from our foreign assistance programs any amounts that a foreign state recipient spends on Russian weapons through Rosoboronexport.  Taking steps to meaningfully obstruct Rosoboronexport’s work and the revenue it provides the Russian state is among the most effective ways we can condemn Putin’s recent aggression. This specific economic sanction will harm Russian interests in a serious way without damaging America’s economy. This is one of many steps we must take to show that Russia’s invasion of the Crimea region is unacceptable.

In the spirit of Hoosier native David Letterman, here are the top 10 things I won't be able to do since Putin banned me from Russia:  10. I won’t be able to complete my granddaughter’s Russian doll collection  9. I won’t be able to compare the Bolshoi Opera House with the Palladium in Carmel  8. I’ll never learn the Russian translation of our dog Hoosier  7. I won’t be able to ski on the slushy slopes of Sochi  6. I won’t be able to buy Marsha a Russian mink coat for Christmas  5. I won’t be able to counsel Duma members on how to say no to a President  4. I’ll have to cancel my tennis match with Maria Sharapova  3. I won’t be able to compare Russiaville, IN with Russia  2. I won’t be able to see if borscht really does taste just like pork tenderloin  1. Our summer vacation in Siberia is a no go
While I’m disappointed that I won’t be able to go on vacation with my family in Siberia this summer, I am honored to be on this list. Putin’s recent aggression is unacceptable, and America must join with our European allies to isolate and punish Russia. I will continue to lead efforts on Capitol Hill to bring Putin to his senses.

I am supporting the Freeing Americans from Inequitable Requirements (FAIR) Act, a bill that would delay the Obamacare mandate on individuals whenever the Obama Administration delays the mandate on employers.  Introduced by Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), the proposal comes on the heels of the administration’s February announcement that it has delayed the employer mandate for employers with 50 and 99 full-time employees until 2016. Over the past year, the administration has delayed or modified Obamacare over 20 times.    This is about basic fairness. Last year, I introduced a bill to ensure individuals and families receive the same exemption from health care mandates that the Obama Administration has given to businesses. The FAIR Act is another effort to achieve this goal.

Last week House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp introduced a proposal to rewrite the U.S. tax code. I am still reviewing the specifics of his proposal, but I applaud Chairman Camp’s effort to move the ball forward on reforming a tax code that is too costly, complex and uncompetitive. Reforming and simplifying our nation’s burdensome tax system will encourage economic growth, create more American jobs and make our country stronger in the global marketplace. Despite a political climate that rewards the status quo, tax reform needs to happen for our economy and global competitiveness. I will continue to join with Congressman Camp and others to move this complex issue in the right direction.

Yesterday marked the five year anniversary of President Obama’s $800 billion stimulus package. In terms of labor participation and addressing unemployment, his so-called “boost to our economy” has failed to meet expectations. The president said he wants to make 2014 “a year of action,” and I agree with this sentiment. He can start by supporting two initiatives that currently have bipartisan backing in Congress: repealing the medical device tax and approving the Keystone XL pipeline. These provisions will create jobs, encourage energy independence, and promote medical research and development.  http://www.jconline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2014302150013

In December 2013, I opposed the legislation that originally created cuts to military retirement pensions, because it made our retired military personnel and their families pay for Washington’s inability to control spending.   I support a plan to pay for a full restoration of military pension benefits by requiring tax filers to submit social security numbers for their children in order to qualify for the additional child tax credit. An estimate from the Congressional Budget Office found that this fix would save approximately $20 billion over 10 years. Unfortunately, Democrats refused to allow a vote on this proposal.   Yesterday the Senate passed legislation that addresses the cuts to military pensions in exchange for alternative spending reductions that won’t take place for 10 years. I opposed this bill because repealing these cuts now with only a promise to pay for it later is fiscally irresponsible and again delays making the hard choices needed to get our financial house in order.  My vote against this measure was based not on military families but on forcing Washington to pay for its spending. While I am glad the benefits have been restored, I remain dismayed by the reality that since this bill will not be paid for until a decade from now, Congress has plenty of time to undo its obligation.
This afternoon I voted against legislation to give the federal government unlimited borrowing authority until March 2015. As I have said repeatedly, one of the greatest threats to America’s future is runaway debt and continued borrowing. Under President Obama, our national debt has increased by nearly seven trillion dollars. I simply cannot support raising the debt limit yet again without even an effort to address our nation’s spending problem.

I am deeply concerned about projected job losses due to Obamacare and the long-term debt forecast in the new Budget and Economic Outlook released today by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  The report reveals that Obamacare is a job-killer and will reduce the number of full-time workers by more than two million as the full impact of the law is felt by the American economy. Labor force participation will continue to decline over the next several years to 62.5 percent by the end of 2017, fueled in part by disincentives to work in Obamacare.  Ironically, many of the same people the law intends to help – low income families – are the ones being punished by Obamacare’s mandates on employers. One of the pillars of The Indiana Way, my legislative agenda for 2014, is promoting alternative solutions to replace Obamacare with step-by-step reforms. Millions of American jobs are dependent on limiting the negative impacts of the law.  The CBO report also projects that the national debt will continue to rise rapidly over the next decade, peaking at 79 percent of gross domestic product by 2024. The gross federal debt in 2014 is projected to reach $17.7 trillion, which is a figure larger than the entire economy and an increase of over $7 trillion since President Obama took office. These findings are another siren alerting Washington to the stark reality that our country desperately needs a real debt-reduction agreement. Making tough fiscal choices is the only way to stabilize the nation’s long-term financial future.

It has been nearly six years since Congress last authorized a farm bill, and Indiana’s agriculture community has waited long enough. Agriculture contributes 190,000 jobs and $38 billion to Indiana’s economy every year. For that reason, today I will vote in favor of a farm bill that for the first time will save taxpayer money. The bill will cut food stamp spending by $8 billion, eliminate nearly 100 federal programs, and end direct payments which combined will save taxpayers over $16 billion.  http://journalgazette.com/article/20140203/LOCAL0202/140209813/0/SEARCH

Following the State Department’s fifth environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline, there is absolutely no reason for President Obama to slow-walk this project any longer.  The State Department report released today reaffirms prior studies that concluded the Keystone XL pipeline does not present any significant environmental risks. The president should accept these findings and authorize the final leg of the Keystone project so Americans can benefit from the pipeline’s job opportunities and increased access to energy.  The $5.3 billion, privately-funded Keystone XL pipeline is the largest, ready-to-build infrastructure project in the United States. The complete route of the pipeline will run from Alberta, Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The pipeline would transport an additional 830,000 barrels of oil per day to U.S. refineries, which includes 100,000 barrels a day from the Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana.
It is unconstitutional for the federal government to require faith-based institutions and businesses to betray the fundamental tenets of their beliefs.

Today I am supporting two pieces of legislation that would convert existing federal education funding into scholarships to help parents of low-income households afford the school of their choice and assist children with disabilities.  The Scholarship for Kids Act, introduced by Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), would create $24 billion worth of scholarships for 11 million low-income children to use toward any public or private school of their parents’ choice. The CHOICE Act, introduced by Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), would create $11 billion in scholarships for six million American children with disabilities, as well as children of military families.   The funding for both bills is redirected from existing federal spending and would not contribute to the deficit. The scholarships would be awarded at the state level. Simultaneously making education more affordable and more available, without adding a dime to the deficit, is common sense. This will put parents in greater control of their child’s educational path.

Rather than use tonight's speech to unite our country, President Obama turned to more political division and even vowed to circumvent the people’s representatives to change existing law with the stroke of his pen.   The president again demonstrated tonight that he is good at making promises, but Hoosiers know that promises don’t matter, actions do. The actions taken by his administration have led to increased spending, more taxes, job losses and a shrinking workforce. After five years of this failed strategy, it’s time for a new game plan and new ideas.  I have put forward a 10-point plan – The Indiana Way – based on bipartisan ideas I gathered from Hoosiers that will strengthen Indiana and our country. Rather than ignore Republican solutions, the president must recognize that in a divided government our country needs a leader that will work with both parties to create the opportunities Americans deserve.

Right now, I'm heading to New Albany as part of my statewide tour to talk with Hoosiers about The Indiana Way – my 10-point legislative plan for the year. I kicked off my tour in Indianapolis earlier this week and visited with Hoosiers in Fort Wayne, South Bend, Valparaiso, Lafayette, Terre Haute, and Evansville. It has been a great road trip so far, and I've been encouraged by the turnout and response from Hoosiers. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of your feedback to help me take YOUR ideas back to Washington and better represent the people of Indiana. In fact, that's how The Indiana Way was created. I have been gathering stories, ideas and input from Hoosiers across the state on ways to address some of the problems facing our communities, state and country. The Indiana Way is based on the input and responses I have received from you. I want to continue to get your feedback and your ideas for better policies. So take a moment to visit my website and let me know what’s on your mind. How are Washington’s policies are affecting you, your family, or your job?

In Indiana we just completed an ambitious seven year, bipartisan plan that significantly improved and expanded Indiana’s highway infrastructure without adding debt or increasing taxes. I’ve tried to bring the Hoosier model to Washington because I believe it is a terrific example of what can happen when we can come together in a bipartisan way with innovative proposals.  I am supporting a bipartisan bill that would jumpstart our nation’s capability to build and repair roads, bridges, highways, ports, schools, and other infrastructure projects. Without spending overstretched federal dollars, the Partnership to Build America Act will help put people back to work building projects across the country, while helping to improve American competitiveness in today’s global economy.   The legislation would establish a $50 billion infrastructure fund that could potentially support hundreds of billions in loan guarantees and financing authority for state and local governments. The fund would finance transportation, energy, communications, water and education infrastructure projects across the country.  The bill encourages American companies to purchase these bonds by allowing them to exclude a certain portion of their overseas earnings from taxation. The amount that they are permitted to repatriate for each dollar of bond purchases will be determined by a competitive auction.  The American Infrastructure Fund created through the Partnership to Build America Act will help finance top priority infrastructure projects across the country. The fund will make guarantees or low-cost loans to state or local governments, nonprofits, private parties and public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure projects that state and local governments prioritize.  I believe this bipartisan legislation brings a creative solution to the challenge of maintaining and expanding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. The bill is supported by numerous groups, including the American Business Conference, the American Planning Association, the Associated General Contractors of America, CEMEX, CH2M Hill, the American Society of Civil Engineers and the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Update:  This afternoon I voted against moving forward on the Unemployment Insurance Extension bill after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected a compromise proposal that would have paid for and reformed the unemployment insurance program.   From the start of this debate, I said that I could only support an extension of benefits if it was paid for without raising more debt and if reforms were made to improve the temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation program.   I joined with a group of Republicans to offer a set of reforms to the unemployment insurance program based on sound policy and bipartisan ideas. Our proposal would have reformed this broken program, repealed recent cuts to military retirement benefits and allowed amendments from both Republicans and Democrats to receive a vote. Unfortunately, Reid rejected our proposal and chose politics above solutions.  Hoosiers and people across the country are fed up with the dysfunction of Harry Reid’s Senate and deserve better leadership. We need to focus on policies that actually grow the economy and get Americans working again, not increase spending and debt.
This morning I offered an amendment to reform the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full Senate that would extend unemployment benefits. My amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force.   The amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving EUC benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work (defined as work within their capabilities) or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency. States would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws.     We need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits. I have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in Indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out. This undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment.   We are waiting to see if Majority Leader Harry Reid will allow votes on Republican amendments.
Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, one of those six, said the group continued to negotiate together and with Democrats to see if some changes could be made to the unemployment bill to keep them on board. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, spent much of Friday on the phone with Mr. Reid, hoping for a breakthrough on Monday. But the senators are smarting over what they see as rough treatment at the hands of the leader.  “I don’t think we should let that be the deciding factor; you don’t want to subject good policy to hurt feelings,” Senator Coats said Friday. “On the other hand if the leader has told you, this is not a one-off — he pretty much said, ‘Forget about offering amendments on anything as long as I’m leader’ — what good does it do to negotiate anything?”
But Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, one of a half-dozen Republicans who helped advance the bill over an initial hurdle earlier in the week, said he hadn't been consulted on any compromise.  Echoing complaints by other members of his party, he said that under Reid's leadership he has been relegated to the sidelines. Indiana voters "didn't send me here to be told just to sit down and forget it," he said.

Today I voted in favor of proceeding to legislation that would extend the expanded emergency unemployment benefits program created after the fiscal crisis of 2008.   While I oppose the current version of the bill, I voted to proceed with considering the unemployment insurance extension because I believe the Senate should have the opportunity to debate and improve this important legislation. If Majority Leader Reid once again obstructs senators from offering amendments, I will oppose final passage of this bill.  The unemployment insurance benefits program needs to be reformed to ensure that it works better for those truly in need and connects those who are unemployed with available jobs. Additionally, Congress cannot continue to rack up more debt and pass the bill along to our children.  Any further extension of this program should be paid for, and I am working on offering amendments that both would offset this cost and help put Americans back to work.

This morning I voted against advancing the budget agreement drafted by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.).   I returned to the Senate to tackle the greatest challenges facing our country, and I have devoted much of my first three years back working with both sides, including the president, to try to achieve a debt-reduction agreement that would put our nation on a path toward fiscal responsibility. While I appreciate the work of Paul Ryan and House Republicans, and I recognize the short-term stability this budget deal offers, I could not overcome the fact that this plan once again allows Congress and the administration to avoid the tough choices we must make to stabilize our long-term fiscal future.   I will remain committed to working with my colleagues to address this challenge.

President Obama claims he has adopted Harry Truman’s motto, “The Buck Stops Here.” Unlike President Truman, our current president placates his critics by deferring to ignorance and pretending to be oblivious about current scandals within his administration.

The House just passed the Alicia Dawn Koehl Respect for National Cemeteries Act. The bill gives the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of the Army authority to disinter ineligible veterans buried in national cemeteries who have committed a federal or state capital crime. Specifically, the legislation ensures the VA will disinter the remains of military veteran Michael L. Anderson who shot and killed Indianapolis resident Alicia Dawn Koehl on May 30 of last year. Thanks to Congresswoman Susan W. Brooks for her leadership on this issue.
Last night the chairmen of the Senate and House Budget Committees announced a budget agreement. While I look forward to reviewing the details, I am concerned that this deal may be another missed opportunity by Congress to make the tough choices needed that will secure our long-term fiscal future.

Today Governor Mike Pence announced that Indiana has maintained its AAA credit ratings from all three bond agencies – Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch Ratings. Since April 2010, the state of Indiana has held AAA ratings with each of these bond agencies.  Indiana’s remarkable fiscal turnaround over the past several years has increased opportunity and prosperity for Hoosier businesses, workers and families. The Hoosier model has resulted in balanced budgets, job creation and a continued triple-A credit rating. In contrast, the approach taken in Washington over the last five years has resulted in fewer jobs, higher debt and downgrades from credit agencies.   Washington is searching for answers to our nation’s financial challenges, and today’s announcement again shows why the Hoosier model is a good blueprint for America’s recovery.

Yesterday the Supreme Court decided to hear a case regarding the constitutionality of Obamacare’s contraception mandate. The Supreme Court will hear lawsuits that were filed by Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. The two companies have owners who have religious objections to providing access to contraceptives that can terminate a pregnancy.    I hope the Supreme Court will strike down the administration’s mandate and rescind this rule because it disregards freedom of religion – a core American principle guaranteed by the First Amendment. It is unconstitutional for the federal government to require faith-based institutions and businesses to betray the fundamental tenets of their beliefs, and the administration’s so-called "conscience protections" are far from adequate.

Today Senate Democrats used the "nuclear option" to change the Senate rules for confirming executive and judicial nominees. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and supporters of Obamacare want a distraction to avoid talking about the damaging impacts the deeply flawed health care law is having on the American people. Majority Leader Reid and Senate Democrats want to pretend that the stories from Hoosiers and millions of people nationwide about losing the coverage they like, losing care to the doctors they trust and facing higher costs despite the president’s many promises are not real, but Americans know otherwise. This action to change the Senate rules and weaken the Founding Fathers’ vision for checks and balances is yet another disturbing power grab and reminds the public of how the Democrats jammed through the unwanted health care law.
These recent allegations regarding the jobs report only add to the mistrust the American people have of the president and his administration.

The Department of Health and Human Services revealed this afternoon that only 701 Hoosiers registered for health insurance plans using Healthcare.gov from October 1 through November 2. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, only 106,000 Americans were able to register for Obamacare in the first month of enrollment, falling significantly short of the administration’s expectation of 500,000 enrollees. Less than 27,000 people were able to select a plan through the federal exchange in the 36 states that do not have a state-based exchange and another 79,000 individuals were able to select plans through state-based exchanges.   These numbers are yet another sign that this law is not working for Hoosiers and Americans nationwide. Across the country, far more people have lost the health care plans they liked than have enrolled in new plans under Obamacare. This is about more than a broken website and more than a list of broken promises from the administration. This is about the lives of Hoosiers and their health care future. This health care law is fatally flawed and it will take far more than operating on the website to resuscitate it.

I oppose discrimination of any kind, and that includes discrimination of individuals or institutions because of their faith and values, which often gets lost and has been lost in the debate on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act or ENDA. This bill raises very serious concerns regarding religious freedom. The so-called protections of religious liberty in the current bill are vaguely defined and do not extend to all organizations that wish to adhere to their moral or religious beliefs in their hiring practices. This bill also would allow employers to be held liable to workplace environment complaints opening the door to the silencing of employees who express their deeply held beliefs. This possibility runs counter to everything America stands for in the realm of free speech.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkKF18Coqc0&feature=c4-overview&list=UUipTNiqJBYHutxpMxo0UOYw

It’s time for the president and Senate Democrats to delay the individual mandate. I am hearing from many Hoosiers that can’t even sign up for Obamacare because the $400 million website is a complete disaster, yet the administration still insists on fining taxpayers if they don’t purchase health insurance. A six-week extension is no consolation for the millions of Americans that are seeing their premiums rise and their paychecks fall. Now is the time to pass my bill to delay the Obamacare mandates for a year and provide all Americans with the same relief that the administration has given to businesses. This legislation passed the House of Representatives with the support of 22 Democrats, and as bipartisan acknowledgement of Obamacare’s failures increases, I will continue to push for a vote in the Senate.

I returned to public service to make the difficult choices necessary to tackle our debt and restore our country’s fiscal footing. To my great disappointment, once again Congress is kicking the can down the road and ignoring what needs to be done. While I deplore supporting yet another short-term Band-Aid, the only thing worse would be a continued government shutdown, the United States defaulting on its debt obligations and the elimination of the spending reductions enacted by Congress in 2011. I have voted for and will continue to support efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare with common-sense health care reforms. It is evident to me that the present strategy has failed to sway the president or Senate Democrats. As we’ve seen from Obamacare’s disastrous rollout, this law’s failures are more than mere glitches, and the fight to repeal it must continue. I am disappointed with this outcome, but my commitment to reducing our debt, growing the economy and getting Americans back to work will not waver. I will be an integral part of the ongoing effort to address our nation’s serious financial challenges.
I just voted against moving forward on legislation to increase the nation’s $16.7 trillion debt ceiling for one year without any commitment to spending reductions or structural reforms. Allowing debt to continue accumulating unchecked on our nation’s credit card ignores the reality of America’s dire financial state. With our national debt currently sitting at over $16.7 trillion dollars and the federal government borrowing $40,000 per second, we cannot afford another short-term Band-Aid. Any increase in the debt limit must be tied to substantive reforms that address the drivers of our debt.

I met today with Senate Republicans, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew at the White House for approximately two hours. For a president who said he would not negotiate, today’s meeting was a step forward. Both sides had the opportunity to present their viewpoints, and it is important that we are at least talking. I will continue to work with my colleagues – in both the House and Senate – to find a solution so we can remove this uncertainty to focus on restoring our fiscal health and growing the economy.
Students from Corydon Central Junior High School had their trip to DC disrupted by the government shutdown. So in lieu of their original plans, Rep. Todd Young and I did our best to answer their questions  about their government.
Today the Senate passed the Honoring the Families of Fallen Soldiers Act (H.J. Res. 91), which would restore the payment of military death benefits that have been halted since the U.S. government shutdown on October 1.  Military families should not be left out in the cold because leaders of the very country their brave sons and daughters died for are failing to govern. It is one thing for Congress and the president to squabble over policy disagreements, but paying out these benefits is not a matter of policy, it’s a matter of principle. This was a promise to families of members of the armed services who voluntarily risked their lives for the United States.
This is good news for our state

Due to the federal government shutdown, I am canceling my mobile office hours in Liberty today and Bloomington tomorrow. My office will reschedule these once the government reopens.
I am joining WLS at 9:15 ET to discuss the government shutdown. You can tune in at http://www.wlsam.com/
As we head toward a government shutdown, the president remains watching from the sidelines. President Obama’s repeated unwillingness to work with Congress has resulted in an ineffective government with a dangerous pattern of careening from crisis to crisis. This is no way to run a country. Americans voted for a divided government, not a nonexistent government. House Republicans sent the Senate a solution that would keep the government open and provide individuals the same relief from Obamacare that the president has given businesses. The measure to delay the individual mandate is similar to legislation I introduced in the Senate. It is deeply frustrating that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the president rejected this solution and are driving us into a government shutdown. American taxpayers deserve better than this from their government. I will continue to work with my colleagues to find a solution so we can focus on restoring our fiscal health and growing the economy.

I know there has been a lot of confusion over what’s been happening on the Senate floor this week. I know Hoosiers want a clear explanation. Please take a moment to watch my speech this morning.
This summer the Obama administration announced it will delay penalties for employers who do not provide health insurance coverage to workers. Since there are still penalties for individuals who do not purchase insurance, I called up my legislation to delay both the employer and individual mandates.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhDthcH4Voc&feature=c4-overview&list=UUipTNiqJBYHutxpMxo0UOYw
Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) today issued the following statement on the passing of Indiana State Representative Phyllis Pond (R-New Haven). Pond, a 35-year veteran of the Indiana House of Representative, was the longest serving female state representative in the history of Indiana:

Marsha and I extend our deepest condolences to her family and also our gratitude for her example of living a life dedicated to serving others and the community."

It’s ironic that the president gave a speech this week touting his economic policies when companies across the country are cutting jobs due to his administration’s unreasonable rules and regulations. The closure of the Tanners Creek power plant is another unfortunate casualty of the administration’s inflexible regulatory machine.

Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) released the following statement after the Obama administration announced it will delay the penalties for employers who do not provide health insurance coverage to workers, but that penalties on individuals not purchasing insurance would still apply:   “This news is evidence that even the Obama administration is realizing the coming train wreck of its own health care law,” said Coats. “While the administration has conveniently delayed this job-killing mandate on employers until after the 2014 elections, Obamacare remains an unwanted burden on Hoosier families and individuals. Rather than delay a bad policy, all Americans should be permanently exempted from Obamacare’s taxes and mandates. We need to repeal the deeply flawed health care law and replace it with step-by-step reforms that actually lower costs and put patients, not bureaucrats, in charge of their own health care decisions.”

Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.), ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, issued the following statement regarding Senate passage of comprehensive immigration reform legislation:  “The American people deserve an immigration system that is fair, effective and delivers on past promises to secure our nation’s borders. While there are some good measures in this legislation, the bill does not avert the fundamental mistake of the 1986 immigration reform act – granting legal status with only promises, not proven results, of border security. In order to obtain the trust of the American people, this legislation needs to ensure real results on securing our borders before beginning the path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.  “As the son of an immigrant and the ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, I will continue working for immigration reform, border security and other measures to successfully address the flow of illegal immigration. I hope the House of Representatives will come forward with alternative legislation that is more credible than what the Senate passed today.”  The Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S.744) in a vote of 68 to 32.

By forcing individuals to buy health insurance, imposing harmful regulations and raising taxes, Obamacare is stifling our economy and burdening Hoosier families. I am committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a health care system that puts patients first, increases the quality of care and decreases costs.
Just voted to require the Senate Democrats' balance their budget in 10 years. Hoosier families and businesses have to balance their budgets and so should the federal government. Instead, the Senate Democrat majority shamefully blocked this effort to provide the American people with a balanced budget. Congress needs to focus on growing the economy, not the government.

North Korea’s provocative nuclear test is the latest reminder of the consequences of allowing rogue nations to develop the world’s most destructive weapons. For years, successive U.S. administrations called a North Korean nuclear weapon unacceptable, the same words used today to describe an Iranian nuclear weapon. If we repeat the mistakes of the past, the brinksmanship we are witnessing on the Korean Peninsula will replicate and multiply in the Middle East, a region already stretching the limits of security.
While jobs and the economy received barely a passing mention in his second inaugural address, I hope President Obama will focus on specific ways he will work with Congress to fix our nation’s fiscal house so we can strengthen our economy and help Americans get back to work.

This morning I spoke with Soledad O’Brien on CNN about my opposition to Chuck Hagel’s nomination for Secretary of Defense.   If Democrats want to salute the president and turn their head the other way, I suppose he could be nominated, but I do think people on both sides, whether Republicans or Democrats, have some real questions about whether this is the right person for this critical position.   My biggest concern is his position on Iran. Iran as we know has been relentlessly pursuing the acquisition of being able to have a nuclear weapons capability. This is a threat not just to the Middle East but to the world.
It has been 1,372 days since the Senate has passed a budget. Nearly four years. That is completely irresponsible. Every Hoosier family and every business in Indiana knows that you cannot be successful and financially sound without creating a budget. Restaurants and coffee shops create a budget. Little league baseball organizations have budgets. Our communities and states have budgets. But our U.S. government does not have a budget. Strengthening our country and putting us back on a sustainable path will not be easy; it will require some sacrifices, but these are the responsibilities we have and we must take this first step. It starts with a budget.

The spend less, borrow less and tax less Hoosier model has resulted in balanced budgets, job creation, and a triple-A credit rating. In contrast, the spend more, borrow more and tax more approach in Washington during the last four years has resulted in fewer jobs, higher debt and a threatened downgrade from credit agencies.
