Sen. Sessions made the following comments on the passage of the 'omnibus' spending package a few moments ago:  “In perhaps its final ignominious act, the Reid Senate has ushered a 1,774 page omnibus funding measure through the world’s greatest deliberative body without a single amendment, a single chance for improvement, or a single opportunity for public participation.     “The United States Senate – challenged directly by the President’s unconstitutional immigration order – has laid prostrate and defenseless.  Reid and his caucus have aggressively blocked a vote on my amendment to prohibit funds for the President’s illegal action – a motion that received unanimous Republican support and also five Democrat votes when last offered.  Surely, Congress should not fund an action which violates our laws and imposes new laws we have refused to pass.  “But the Senate has made no attempt to defend itself, the Constitution and the citizens we are supposed to represent.  Once again, Senate Democrats rallied around their leader to serve as the Administration’s imperial guard.  They acted one more time to protect the White House at the expense of their own constituents.  Why can’t Americans get representation in their own Senate?  “President Obama’s order violates the laws Congress has passed in order to force on the nation laws Congress has refused to pass. His order gives work permits, photo ID’s, Social Security, Medicare and free tax credits to illegal immigrants – taking jobs, wages and benefits directly from struggling Americans and lawful immigrants.  “It is not a choice but a duty: the new Senate in January must have no higher priority than to block this amnesty and defend the people who sent us here.  Every American must use the days and weeks ahead to call their lawmakers and ask them simply: who do you represent?”

Text of Sen. Sessions' remarks this evening on the economic impacts of the President's executive order.
Sen. Sessions will be speaking on the floor shortly on the need to block funds for executive amnesty. You can watch here:
Sen. Sessions released the following statement tonight:  “For the sake of the Constitution and our constituents, Congress should fund the government but not fund the President’s unlawful amnesty.  In plain violation of law, the President’s order gives amnesty and work permits to 5 million illegal immigrants – allowing them to take jobs directly from struggling Americans.  Unfortunately, not only has Congress so far not attempted any effective action to block the President’s amnesty, but the legislation that passed tonight funds through September of next year many policies that the House itself rejected only a few months ago.  In effect, the omnibus provides the Administration with billions of dollars to carry out President Obama’s resettlement plan for illegal immigrants in U.S. communities.  The legislation also continues to allow the recipients of the President’s amnesty to receive billions of dollars in government checks in the form of tax credits and to participate in programs through myriad government agencies such as Social Security and Medicare.  The American people are justly worried about their jobs, their schools, and their communities.  They have rightly demanded a lawful system of immigration that serves their interests – not the special interests.  They have correctly pleaded with their lawmakers to finally adopt immigration policies that put their needs – the needs of American citizens – first.  So, to them I say: we are only just beginning.  We are going to fight harder than we ever have before.   Those who think that this issue will recede, or fade away, are mistaken.  The voice of the American people will be heard.”

An excerpt of Sen. Sessions' statement today on the discovery of a new executive amnesty facility:  “It has just been discovered today that the Obama Administration is now opening a new USCIS facility in Crystal City, Virginia, for the purpose of immediately implementing the President’s imperial immigration decree. They are in the process of hiring 1,000 full-time staff to quickly approve applications for the President’s illegal amnesty, which will provide work permits, photo ID’s, Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants—all benefits rejected by Congress.   This action will mean that American workers, their sons, their daughters, their parents, will now have to compete directly for jobs, wages, and benefits with millions of illegal immigrants.   The American people need a voice. Why were we elected, if not to serve the citizens who sent us here?”
Sen. Sessions issued the following statement today urging the House not to advance a spending bill unless it blocks executive amnesty:  “The Chairman of the Republican Party made a promise to America on executive amnesty: ‘We can’t allow it to happen and we won’t let it happen… everything we can do to stop it we will.’  Unfortunately, the plan now being circulated in the House fails to meet that test. The executive amnesty language is substantially weaker than the language the House adopted this summer, and does not reject the central tenets of the President’s plan: work permits, Social Security, and Medicare to 5 million illegal immigrants—reducing wages, jobs, and benefits for Americans.  Congress considered and rejected these changes to immigration law in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. The President’s action erases the laws Congress has passed in order to implement laws Congress has refused to pass.  Now the President demands Congress fund his imperial decree and declare its own irrelevance.  That is why Congress must respond to the President’s unlawful action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty. This is a perfectly sound and routine application of congressional authority. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reports that last year’s omnibus spending bill included 16 such funding restrictions on fee-based programs.  Such a plan would put the focus where it belongs: on Senate Democrats. They are the ones who should be made to choose sides—save Obama’s amnesty or save Americans’ jobs and borders.  Polling shows voters believe that Americans should get preference for available jobs by almost a 10-1 margin. Republicans should not be timid or apologetic, but mount a bold defense of struggling Americans.  Billions of dollars and countless hours have been spent advocating immigration policies that help everyone but the actual citizens of this country. Who will be their voice, if not us?”

Sen. Sessions will be on LIVE tonight at 9:10 PM ET on FOX News' "Kelly File" to discuss executive amnesty.
Sen. Sessions released the following statement tonight on President Obama’s announced executive amnesty:  “President Obama’s executive amnesty violates the laws Congress has passed in order to create and implement laws Congress has refused to pass.  The President is providing an estimated 5 million illegal immigrants with social security numbers, photo IDs and work permits—allowing them to now take jobs directly from struggling Americans during a time of record immigration, low wages, and high joblessness.  This amnesty plan was rejected by the American people’s Congress.  By refusing to carry out the laws of the United States in order to make his own, the President is endangering our entire Constitutional order.  The President’s plan will apparently also allow many illegal immigrants to receive green cards and become legal permanent residents—meaning they can access almost all U.S. welfare programs, have lifetime work authorization, obtain citizenship, and sponsor foreign relatives to join them in the U.S.  Law enforcement has warned this unprecedented amnesty will unleash a ‘tidal wave’ of new illegal immigration flooding into American neighborhoods at taxpayers’ expense.  The President’s plan also calls for boosting foreign worker programs for IT companies that experts tell us displace U.S. workers and keep wages low.  The President’s unconstitutional action is a direct threat to our Republican system of government and will have catastrophic consequences for the American people.  It must be stopped.  And the way to stop it is by using Congress’ power of the purse.  The House should send the Senate a government funding bill which ensures no funds can be spent for this unlawful purpose.  If Reid’s Senate Democrats vote to surrender their own institution to an imperial dictate and block the measure, then the House should send a short-term funding measure so the new GOP majority can be sworn in and pass a funding bill with the needed language.  Congress has no higher duty than to protect the American people and our Constitution.  The President’s action is a threat to every working person in this country—their jobs, wages, dreams, hopes and futures.  For years, the American people have begged and pleaded for a lawful system of immigration that serves the nation and makes us proud—but the politicians have refused, refused, refused.  It is time to stand strong for the American people.  It is time to champion the interests of those constantly neglected on the question of immigration: the men and women and children we represent—the citizens of this country to whom we owe our ultimate allegiance.  Every American must ask their Senator where they stand.”
Sen. Sessions released the following statement today about the President’s impending executive amnesty:  “President Obama previously said he could not issue an executive amnesty because ‘I’m the President of the United States, I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.’ Well, apparently we now have an ‘Emperor of the United States.’ President Obama’s immigration order would provide illegal immigrants with the exact benefits Congress has repeatedly rejected: Social Security numbers, photo IDs and work permits—which will allow them to now take jobs directly from struggling Americans in every occupation. Congress must not allow this unconstitutional action. That means Congress should fund the government while ensuring that no funds can be spent on this unlawful purpose.”
Sen. Sessions published an op-ed in Politico explaining that Congress must include in its government funding bill a prohibition on executive amnesty. Sen. Sessions wrote in part:   "We cannot surrender Congress’ most powerful Constitutional tool before a single newly elected Republican is sworn-in...Obama's immigration orders will have a crushing impact on the jobs, wages, schools, hospitals, police departments, and communities of our constituents. The consequences will be swift, profound, and catastrophic. Who will protect them, if not us?   In a battle between Congress and the President—over whether to save our citizens’ jobs, laws, and borders, or whether to eliminate them—there is no doubt the public will be firmly on our side.   We cannot yield to open borders. We cannot let one executive edict erase the immigration laws of an entire nation. If we believe America is a sovereign country, with enforceable boundaries, and a duty to protect its own people, then we have no choice but to fight and to win."

Here is an excerpt from Sen. Sessions' statement today concerning the latest developments with the President's immigration orders:  “The President is systemically stripping away the immigration protections to which every single American worker and their family is entitled. He doesn't care how this impacts Americans’ jobs, wages, schools, tax bills, hospitals, police departments, or communities...  The world has turned upside down. Instead of serving the interests of the American worker, the policies of President Obama and every Senate Democrat serve the needs of special interests and global CEOs who fail to understand the duty a nation owes to its own people. But the citizens of this country still hold the power, and through their voice, they can turn the country right-side up again.”

Sen. Sessions sounded the alarm over the Obama Administration's solicitation for 34 million green cards and work permits to institute executive immigration orders:  “This revelation provides startling confirmation of the crisis facing our Republic. The President is preparing to issue work authorization and ‘legal’ status to millions of individuals illegally present in the country, in violation of plain statute. His planned executive immigration order will nullify the immigration laws of the United States and its sovereign people. But rather than defend the legal rights and jobs of their constituents, Senate Democrats have surrendered them to this lawless scheme. The remedy lies in the hands of the voting public.”
Sen. Sessions today addressed the Ebola crisis and troubling new executive immigration orders issued by the Administration:  “Ebola is a health crisis. Yet the President has appointed as his new Ebola ‘czar’ a partisan loyalist whose expertise is politics—not health. One would think, faced with the prospect of an epidemic, the President would task an expert in epidemiology not an expert in political spin. Sound bites are not going to deter a single infection or save a single life. The American people can have zero confidence in Ron Klain’s competence to carry out this critical role.  At the senior levels of this government, in positions of extraordinary responsibility, the President has surrounded himself with loyalists—individuals who were selected precisely because they are not independent, will not tell the President ‘no’, and will not have any problem in feeding bogus political spin to the media.  The President’s Director of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell, was promoted after refusing to answer even those most basic financial questions from Congress during her dismal tenure at the Office of Management and Budget. Burwell, a former campaign operative, was tasked with overseeing the nation’s healthcare system despite no consequential health care experience. Secretary Jeh Johnson was chosen to head the one of the largest and most important departments of government despite being a political lawyer with no relevant background. Johnson has devoted his short tenure not to strengthening enforcement but dismantling it. Just today—as American citizens face a jobs crisis, debt crisis, border crisis, security crisis, and now a health crisis—Secretary Johnson announced actions not to restore gutted enforcement, but further steps to open our borders. DHS is now extending what amounts to a perpetual amnesty to thousands of immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, while expediting immigration from Haiti at a time when we can’t keep track of the millions we are already admitting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The danger at this moment is profound. We need to be barring visas and travel from Ebola-impacted regions. Additionally, should there be an outbreak in Latin America, General John Kelly of SOUTHCOM has warned that it would cause a ‘mass migration’ from Latin America of those seeking free medical treatment in the United States. ‘If it breaks out, it’s literally Katie bar the door,’ he warned. Does anyone believe that this Administration is prepared to protect this country from such a scenario?  The Administration continues to refuse to implement even the most commonsense immigration controls to protect public health and public tax dollars. Mr. Klain’s appointment, unfortunately, suggests things will get worse—not better.”
Sen. Sessions issued the following comments today on the WH’s admission that the timing of executive amnesty for after the election was designed to shield Senate Democrats:  "One is left breathless by the White House’s admission that it is timing its planned nullification of America’s immigration laws for after election day in the hope that it will spare Senate Democrats from the public’s wrath. Instead of rebelling against executive amnesty, Senate Democrats have supported it every step of the way. They continue to put their loyalty to Leader Reid and the White House ahead of the interests of the struggling American workers they are supposed to represent. America’s borders are not up for debate. Activist CEOs do not get to sit in a secret meeting at the White House, flanked by amnesty activists and Democrat consultants, and decide it’s time to scrub away our national boundaries.  We must not let this happen. We will not let this happen. The people of this country will not tolerate the decimation of their laws, borders, and wages."

In the wake of Sen. Sessions' recent remarks outlining the difficult conditions facing US workers, the following op-ed from one of the nation's top academics appeared in US News and World Report.  The author said in part:   "The highly profitable IT industry, for example, is devoting millions to convince Congress and the White House to provide its employers with more low-cost, foreign guestworkers instead of trying to attract and retain employees from an ample domestic labor pool of native and immigrant citizens and permanent residents. Guestworkers currently make up two-thirds of all new IT hires, but employers are demanding further increases. If such lobbying efforts succeed, firms will have enough guestworkers for at least 100 percent of their new hiring and can continue to legally substitute these younger workers for current employees, holding down wages for both them and new hires.”

Sen. Sessions delivered a speech earlier this week on the coordination between the White House, Senate Democrats, and immigration lobbyists in crafting unlawful executive actions. Here is an excerpt of his remarks:  "White House officials are meeting with the world's most powerful corporate and immigration lobbyists and activists who think border controls are for the little people.  The administration is meeting with the elite, the cosmopolitan set, who scorn and mock the concerns of everyday Americans who are concerned about their schools, jobs, wages, communities, and hospitals. These great and powerful citizens of the world don't care much about old fashioned things like national boundaries, national sovereignty, and immigration control—let alone the constitutional separation of powers."

Sen. Sessions is speaking now on the Senate floor about the President's announcement that he will grant executive amnesty after the midterms.
Sen. Sessions made the following comment in response to the White House announcement concerning the President's planned executive amnesty for millions who illegally entered the U.S., overstayed visas or defrauded immigration authorities:  “President Obama has openly reaffirmed his unconstitutional plan to nullify our nation’s sovereign laws, issuing executive amnesty and work permits to millions of illegal immigrants.  In so doing, he will wipe away American workers’ lawful immigration protections.  Illegal workers will be instantly allowed to take precious jobs directly from struggling Americans in every occupation in America.  Countless more unlawful workers will pour across the border and overstay their visas.  These executive actions will incentivize a tsunami of illegality.   President Obama’s announcement that this would come only after the midterm elections is of course an attempt to protect the Senate Democrat incumbents who have enabled President’s Obama lawless immigration decrees every step of the way.    This White House, and this Senate Democrat Conference, view everyday Americans – who want their laws enforced and their borders controlled – with contempt.  They believe our nation’s immigration policy should be decided by a handful of the world’s most elite CEOs and most powerful open borders lobbyists, operating in secrecy and outside our open governmental process.   There must be no confusion on this point: not one Senate Democrat has supported the House bill to stop this executive action and demanded that Leader Reid bring it to a vote.  Every Senate Democrat is therefore the President’s direct partner in this lawless scheme.  The remedy now is for the American voter to send a message that will thunder through the halls of Congress.  Though President Obama and his Senate Democrats refuse to believe so, the American citizen is still in charge of this government and this country.”
Sen. Sessions commented on Senate Democrats' call for executive amnesty—after the election:  “A development today reported by Politico ought to send shudders down the spine of those who care about our representative system of government. In an article entitled ‘More Senate Democrats urge Obama to delay immigration order,’ we learn that Senate Democrats—instead of opposing the President’s executive amnesty—urge him to issue it after they face voters in November. As one office relayed to Politico: ‘Obama should use his executive authority to make fixes to the immigration system, but after the November elections.’  The only thing that is more shocking than Senate Democrats’ support for the President’s planned executive amnesty is the cravenness of asking him to proceed beginning the day after the midterms. Once again, powerful politicians are colluding with powerful interest groups to deny you, the American citizen, the protection of your laws and your voice in government. They don’t care what you want, or what you think—they scorn and mock our good and decent citizens for wishing their laws to be enforced.  Never in recent memory has the divide between the everyday citizen and the political elite been as wide as it is now.  Just today, the President reiterated his commitment to implement an executive amnesty that would include work authorization for millions of people who entered illegally or illegally overstayed a visa—allowing them to compete for any job in America. His planned action would also reportedly include a massive boost to the already-huge supply of low-wage labor brought into the U.S. for large corporations.  The immigration debate comes down to several central questions:      - Does our country have the right to control its borders and decide who comes to live and work here?    - Do citizens have the right to expect and demand that the laws passed by their elected representatives be enforced?     - Should American workers get priority for jobs and wages?  Any Senator who believes the answers to these questions are ‘yes’ must support the House-passed bill to block the President’s planned executive amnesty—and demand Leader Reid call it up for a vote. Not one Senate Democrat has done so.  A sovereign nation establishes rules about who can enter, work, and live within its borders. In every imaginable way, the President has worked to dismantle these rules—on the border, in our courts, through our visa system, through our asylum system, through our exit-entry system. And with this planned executive action, the President proposes to scrub away what remains of these rules. And Senate Democrats will have been partners in its commission.”

“‘[Senate Democrats] have refused to support the House-passed legislation to block the President’s executive actions, surrendering the Senate and their citizen constituents to an unconstitutional scheme to nullify America’s sovereign laws and sovereign borders [said Sen. Sessions]’…  ‘If implemented, the President’s new executive actions would functionally end what little remains of interior immigration enforcement, giving free license to every person in the world—here today or planning to come tomorrow—to violate our immigration laws with impunity’…  ‘We further know that these executive actions will likely also include a massive importation of new foreign workers—on top of the large existing flow—to take even more jobs in the United States,’ [Sessions added]. ‘The result would be disastrous for struggling workers—coming on the heels of four decades of continued record immigration into the U.S., coinciding with falling wages and a shrinking middle class’…  ‘The citizens of this country retain the ultimate power, as they always have,’ [Sessions continued]. ‘They will not let this stand. They will demand a Senate vote on the House bill to stop this executive amnesty. And they will hold accountable any and all in Congress who fail to resist the President’s lawless decree.’”

They’re worried about their children being able to find a job because they’re going to college and graduating, and they still don’t have jobs,' Sessions said during a gathering of local Republicans in Jasper Wednesday morning.  "Sessions cited a recent report by the United States Conference of Mayors that the average wages for workers in the manufacturing and construction sectors are down 23 percent since the 2008 recession.  "Sessions said Republicans need to defend American workers from an influx of foreign labor.  "He added that he does not support allowing more high-skilled guest workers to enter the U.S., a plan advocated by entrepreneurs Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Sheldon Adelson in a recent New York Times op-ed.  "'We need to get our people working, off of welfare and into jobs with decent wages that are going up instead of going down,' Sessions said...  "Sessions also expressed concerns about Chinese trade practices that were highlighted in a recent National Review cover story.  "'Our trading partners are cheating us — manipulating currency, stealing our technology, cheating us day after day,' Sessions said. 'They say if we stand up and fight, then it will cause a trade war, but we’re already in a trade war. We’re just not fighting.'”

Sen. Sessions has emphasized the need to change America’s immigration and economic policies so wages can rise for U.S. workers.  Here is an excerpt from a new CBS news report:  “According to a new report from the National Employment Law Project... Real median hourly wages have declined across low, middle and high income levels from 2009 through 2013… No matter if workers were in the lowest bracket ($8.84 to $10.85 an hour) or the highest ($31.40 to $86.34), median hourly wages declined when you take into account the impact of inflation. So while your utilities and grocery bills continue to rise, your take-home pay, in real dollars, may not be going as far as it had before the recession. Across all occupations, real median hourly wages slipped 3.4 percent since 2009…”

An excerpt from Sen. Sessions' statement follows below:  “We have communities throughout America that are barely scraping by. Tens of millions of Americans are on welfare, unemployment, and public assistance.

Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' warning about President's planned immigration actions:  "With American workers hurting, special interest groups are collaborating with the White House on measures that would pull down wages and impoverish working Americans?...  These planned executive actions would nullify our laws, invite a massive new wave of unimpeded illegality, and strip the American people of their lawful right to have their jobs and communities protected."
Today, Sen. Sessions emphasized the importance of Americans in all states reaching out to their Senators about the President’s executive amnesty.  Read the entire statement below:  “Recent developments suggest the President’s planned executive amnesty could be increasingly imminent and broad in scope. House Democrat Leader Pelosi—clearly one of the White House’s closest allies—has just urged the President to issue ‘the broadest possible’ executive actions. Open borders groups have grown bolder and louder in their unlawful demands, launching a campaign for the President to ‘go big,’ and demanding that he ‘stand up’ to Congress and ‘expand DACA.’  Will Congress defend itself? Will it defend the country's laws, its people, and the idea that a nation has enforceable borders that cannot be waived away with the flick of a pen?  While the Senate recesses, activist groups and special interest lobbyists are huddling with the White House to implement through executive action that which Congress explicitly rejected. These are the same groups who met to devise the Senate’s ‘Gang of Eight’ plan, until that effort was exposed and then halted by the American people and their representatives in the House.  It is chilling to consider now that these groups, frustrated in their aims by our Constitutional system of government, are plotting with the Obama Administration to collect their spoils through executive fiat.  The Associated Press writes:  ‘White House officials are making plans to act before November's mid-term elections to grant work permits to potentially millions of immigrants who are in this country illegally…White House officials led by Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Munoz and White House Counsel Neil Eggleston, along with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, have been working to chart a plan on executive actions Obama could take, hosting frequent meetings with interest groups… the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it is actively working to determine whether there are steps Obama could take by executive action that could help the business community.’  So, with American workers hurting, special interest groups are collaborating with the White House on measures that would pull down wages and impoverish working Americans?  The steps that must be taken are clear: the Senate must vote on the House-passed measure to stop these unlawful actions. It is true that Majority Leader Reid is blocking it from a vote. But Reid acts only with the blessing of his members in the Democrat conference—so the American people have the power to force it to a vote through their elected Senators.  Any Senator who fails to request such a vote is complicit in these planned actions.  The American people have begged and pleaded for years for our immigration laws to be enforced. But the politicians have refused.   Now these planned executive actions would nullify our laws, invite a massive new wave of unimpeded illegality, and strip the American people of their lawful right to have their jobs and communities protected.  This must be stopped.  And the American people have the power to stop it. That begins with asking a simple question: where do your Senators stand?”

Sen. Sessions: "We need to remember who we represent. It’s the people of this country, last I heard."
Sen. Sessions released the following statement announcing opposition to both the House and Senate border legislation up for consideration today:  “With great concern, we as policy makers must face the reality that the President is openly planning to use executive actions to provide amnesty and work permits to millions without any lawful authority. The Congress has a duty to resist. Legislation currently pending in both chambers fails to meet this test and therefore must be opposed.  My position from the beginning has been that Congress should not pass any border bill which does not block funding for the President’s planned executive amnesty. The House border supplemental contains no language on executive action and is the only bill that would receive consideration in the Senate. The separate House measure on executive actions fails to place effective restrictions on the President’s ability to grant unlawful amnesty and work permits. For Congress to successfully stand against the President’s nullification plans, it must adopt the language proposed by Senator Cruz.”

The Wall Street Journal reports today that the President’s plan to issue 5-6 million work permits to illegal immigrants and visa overstays may be announced right after Labor Day weekend. Sen. Sessions has urged members of the public to contact their lawmakers and ask to know where they stand on the issue of protecting the American worker and Constitution from the President’s unlawful amnesty actions. Yesterday, Sen. Sessions stated:   “After years of falling wages and rising joblessness, American workers are pleading for someone to hear them. How can it be that our President is brazenly advertising that he will nullify and strip away American workers’ immigration protections, and their own elected leaders will not rise to their defense? Or to the defense of our laws and our Constitutional order?”
Sen. Sessions' statement criticizing the House leaders' border spending bill can be read below:  “The Obama Administration has openly declared its plan to implement a unilateral executive amnesty for 5–6 million more illegal immigrants. This unlawful amnesty—urged on by congressional Democrats—would include work permits, taking jobs directly from millions of struggling American citizens.  Any action Congress might consider to address the current border crisis would be futile should the President go forward with these lawless actions. Congress must speak out and fight against them. It must use its spending power to stop the President’s executive amnesty.  That the House leaders’ border package includes no language on executive actions is surrender to a lawless President. And it is a submission to the subordination of congressional power.  After years of falling wages and rising joblessness, American workers are pleading for someone to hear them. How can it be that our President is brazenly advertising that he will nullify and strip away American workers’ immigration protections, and their own elected leaders will not rise to their defense? Or to the defense of our laws and our Constitutional order?  There are other grave concerns with the Granger package as well: because it does not fix our asylum rules and loopholes, the end result of the additional judges and hearings will be more illegal immigrants gaining asylum and access to U.S. welfare. It is a plan for expedited asylum, not expedited removal.  Nor will this package make our rogue President actively enforce anything, coming nowhere close to the kinds of reasonable enforcement activities needed to restore the interior application of our immigration laws.  And finally, a package that is silent on blocking executive amnesty creates an opportunity for Senate Democrats to add elements of their party’s open borders and mass immigration agenda.  This legislation is unworthy of support.”
Sen. Sessions earlier on the floor today explained another crucial reason for lawmakers to back legislation blocking Obama's executive amnesty: "It will stop [the President's planned] work authorizations for six million [illegal immigrants] who will then be able to take any job in America at a time of high unemployment and falling wages, thereby protecting American workers."  Sessions urged the public to find out where their lawmakers stand.
Sen. Sessions spoke on the floor today to encourage his colleagues to fight President Obama’s planned executive amnesty -- and to encourage the American people to demand to know where their representatives stand on the issue.  Sessions commented in part:   “American people will not be mocked. They have begged and pleaded for our nation's immigration law to be enforced for 30 or 40 years… The politicians have refused, refused, refused, refused. The American public defeated amnesty after amnesty after amnesty and they will not sit back and allow the president to implement through unlawful fiat what they have defeated through the democratic process. They must not yield to this.  "In effect, the President is preparing to assume for himself the absolute power to set immigration law in America.  The absolute power to determine who may enter and who may work—not matter what the law says—by the millions… The American people will fight this.  They will resist… So I am calling on all Members of Congress today to stand up to the President’s lawless actions and sponsor legislation to block [these actions].  I am calling on all Members of Congress today to oppose any border supplemental that does not include such language.  I am calling on every person in this body, and in the House, to stand and be counted at this perilous hour.  I am calling on the American people to phone their representative and ask them: where do you stand?   "All of us were elected by citizens to serve them and their constitution.  Will we answer that call?  Where will history record you stood at this hour?” 
Be sure to tune in to Sen. Sessions' floor speech on President Obama's planned executive amnesty and work permitting at 2:45pm ET / 1:45pm CT. Sen. Sessions is encouraging the American public to call their members of Congress to ask where they stand on this fundamental issue.
Sen. Sessions: "The American people have begged and pleaded for years for our laws to be enforced.  We have people in our own country living in violence, fear, and poverty every single day.  They have demanded an immigration policy that puts their jobs, wages, and communities first. Every citizen should pick up the phone and ask of their congressional representative: where do you stand?”"
Please share the following with your friends and colleagues:   Sen. Sessions today urged members of the public to call their representatives and tell them to block President Obama’s plan to grant amnesty and work permits to another 5-6 million illegal immigrants through executive action. You can read the full statement at the link below:
Sen. Sessions issues warning to America: President Obama is planning to grant administrative amnesty and work permits to 5-6 million immigrants. Sessions, joined by Senator Cruz, urged the public to speak out:
Sessions made the following comments on the border plan released by the so-called House Working Group:  “Granting the President new funds without tackling these [threatened executive action] orders would be an institutional surrender to the planned illegality… the House working group did not mention President Obama even once in their released findings…they made no mention of the President’s threat of sweeping new executive actions. Multiple reports indicate that these imminent actions are likely to take the form of administrative amnesty and work permits for 5-6 million illegal immigrants. Any attempt at improving the border situation would be rendered utterly void if the President follows through on his dramatic nullification acts...  … it is curious that the proposal makes no mention of the needs of Americans. Yes, this is a humanitarian crisis. But it is also a legal crisis. And so too is it a crisis for the American people who have begged and pleaded for a lawful system of immigration that serves their interests, protects their jobs, and increases their wages. Republicans should not be timid or apologetic, but present a bold defense of the American people. The House GOP has so far been the last bulwark protecting working Americans; it would be tragic for that defense to buckle in the closing days of this Congress.”

An excerpt from Sen. Sessions' remarks about Microsoft lobbying for large guest worker expansions while laying of its domestic workforce en masse:  “[Bill Gates] questions whether the members of Congress who don't pass laws like he wants on immigration are honoring their duty to the 300 million Americans that we collectively represent.  I feel a deep duty to the millions of Alabamians I represent and the whole country, and I do my best every day to ask what’s in their interest. And as far as I’m concerned… those three billionaires [Gates, Buffett, Adelson] have three votes. The individual who works stocking the shelves at the grocery store, the barber, the doctor, the lawyer, the cleaners operator, [and] the person who picks up our garbage are every bit as valuable as they are. So I know who I represent. I represent citizens of the United States of America…”
Click here to read Sen. Sessions letter to his colleagues regarding the immigration crisis. The letter reads in part: “Congress must not acquiesce to spending more taxpayer dollars until the President unequivocally rescinds his threat of more illegal executive action… Congress cannot surrender to this lawlessness. Acting in defense of Congress, our constituents, and their communities, we must stand firm. This transcends politics. It is about our duty as constitutional officeholders. It is about the solemn oath we all took as Members of Congress.”
Today, Sen. Sessions offered a comment on the recent New York Times op-ed penned by Mr. Gates, Mr. Adelson, and Mr. Buffett:  “The President cannot be trusted to enforce any immigration law.  We are in the midst of a border disaster—created by the President’s lawlessness—and Mr. Adelson, Mr. Gates, and Mr. Buffett want to implement a massive amnesty bill.  Such a plan would wreak havoc on our nation’s laws and borders, which mean a great deal to the good and decent citizens of this country. It is clear that three of the richest billionaires in the world have no clue what Congress ‘owe[s] to the 318 million who employ them’. We owe them our loyalty, our compassion, our devotion. It is precisely because of our duty to the working people of this country that we must stop legislation that would import tens of millions of lower-wage workers to replace them.”
Sen. Sessions spoke on the Senate floor yesterday about Reid's strong-arm tactic of blocking all Senators from offering amendments:  “The reason the Majority Leader will not allow amendments is because he wants to protect his members from actually being held accountable by the voters of the United States of America… That’s what it’s all about. It’s gone on way too long. It’s demeaning this Senate, and he demeans the loyal opposition who are doing the only thing they have as a tool, which is refuse to move forward with a bill if the Majority Leader is going to use parliamentary maneuvers to block anybody’s amendment…   It’s not a question of time. It’s a question of control [and] domination of the Senate. The Majority Leader is not entitled to do that. He’s just not. It is not going to continue, and this is going to be broken sooner or later.”

Sen. Sessions commented today on the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Hobby Lobby case:  “Hobby Lobby is a family business that objected to a federal government mandate requiring them to pay for drugs like Plan B and Ella, which they argued was a violation of their pro-life religious views. Today’s ruling is an important step towards restoring the religious freedoms that the President’s health care law suppressed. And it is yet another rebuke for an Administration that does not recognize the limits on its power.”

Today, Senator Sessions urged the Senate not to adjourn for recess but instead to take action to address the legal and humanitarian crisis on the border. Sessions asked for the Senate to take up and pass two bills: one to prevent companies from hiring illegal workers, the other to prevent those here illegally from receiving large taxpayer benefits. Sessions’ measure was blocked by Sen. Reid’s Majority, through Senator Dick Durbin. Sessions asked:   “They want to adjourn this chamber, go home to their barbecues, work on their reelection campaigns… How can any of us relax at an Independence Day barbecue next week knowing at this very moment the nation's sovereignty is being eroded?”

Sen. Sessions made the following comments today in response to the Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling against unconstitutional executive appointments that bypass Congress:  “President Obama has circumvented Congress and ignored the Constitution whenever it is convenient for the implementation of his agenda. Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a powerful repudiation of a White House that believes it is above the law.    The White House engaged in a clear, dramatic and willful violation of the Constitution’s ‘advice and consent’ clause. Any President who respected the limits of their constitutional power should be shamed by this unanimous rebuke from the Supreme Court.  The task ahead for Congress is to work each day to reassert its constitutional authority and to reign in an Executive Branch that seeks to make its own laws. This will not be possible merely by filing lawsuits: Congress must be willing to use its constitutional authority, including its appropriations powers, to protect the American people and the rule of law.”
Here is an excerpt from Ranking Member Sessions' statement announcing his opposition to the nomination of HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan to be the director of the Office of Management and Budget:  "Since taking office, the President has staffed his budget office with political loyalists and insiders who have ignored our perilous financial condition and taken no steps to repair it. The President’s budget office has submitted the most irresponsible budget plans in history, surging spending and debt and busting in-law spending caps—while presenting them to the public as doing the opposite. And for five consecutive years, they have flatly refused to follow plain law that requires them to submit a plan resolving Medicare’s insolvency...  [Now,] in Mr. Donovan, we have an inexperienced nominee with a poor record of fiscal management and no demonstrated commitment to financial discipline."
Here is an excerpt from Sen. Sessions new op-ed about how irresponsible immigration policies are hurting American workers and their wages:  "For too long, the immigration debate has been driven by the needs of politicians, business interests, and immigration activists who fail to appreciate that a nation owes certain obligations to its own citizens.   Consider immigration policy from the viewpoint of a middle-aged unemployed American who has to borrow gas money to drive to a job interview 100 miles away. Imagine how his or her life is affected when the company gives that open job to a temporary guest worker hired from 10,000 miles away. Imagine what any of the 58 million working-age Americans who don’t have jobs might have to say to the lawmakers and activists who claim there is a 'labor shortage'."

Sessions' comments at today's Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety hearing:  “The President on November 14, 2012 said, ‘The temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted, even ten years ago.’ Then on May 29, 2013 [President Obama] said, ‘We also know that the climate is warming faster than anybody anticipated five or ten years ago.’  So, I would ask each of our former [EPA] Administrators if any of you agree that is an accurate statement [from President Obama] on climate. So if you do, raise your hand. Thank you. The record will reflect no one raised their hands.”

Sen. Sessions issued the following comments today about the need to combat illicit trading practices: "I am pleased to join Senator Brown in sending a letter to President Obama about foreign currency manipulation that is unfairly impacting our American workers. An April 2014 report from the Treasury Department found that China was grossly manipulating their currency—an improper practice that artificially lowers the price of imported Chinese goods and puts Americans out of work. Our trade laws must ensure that the people living and working in the U.S. can compete on a level playing field. We must defend the legitimate interests of American workers on the world stage. Trading agreements are like contracts for mutual benefit, and when one party fails to act in accordance with the agreement, action must be taken. For many years now, our government has failed in that task and allowed American factories to shutter and good-paying middle class jobs to disappear. President Obama’s weak trade stance, like that of his predecessors in the White House, has directly harmed U.S. workers and manufacturing.  The legislation I am sponsoring with Senator Brown, The Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act, is important to achieve a market-based exchange rate that will address currency manipulation to ensure our businesses and workers can fairly compete in the global marketplace.”

Sen. Sessions released the following comments today about the deteriorating situation on the US border:  “The rising crisis at the border is the direct and predictable result of actions taken by President Obama. He and his Administration have announced to the world that they will not enforce America’s immigration laws, and have emphasized in particular that foreign youth will be exempted from these laws. The world has heard the President’s call, and illegal immigrants are pouring across the border in pursuit of his promised amnesty. President Obama is responsible for this calamity, and only by declaring to the world that our border is no longer open—and that the law will be restored—can this emergency be stopped.   This is critically necessary for humanitarian reasons: it is simply wrong for the President to continue incentivizing youth and their families to undertake these perilous treks. Nor can the U.S. afford the costs associated with ‘resettling’ these arrivals, estimated by the White House to reach nearly $2.3 billion next year alone. Adding to the incentive, politicians in both parties have promised citizenship for anyone in the world who arrives illegally in the country by a certain age. The first overriding goal must always be to reduce lawlessness, not incentivize it.  The New York Times similarly reported that the knowledge of non-enforcement in the U.S. is leading to the surge in illegality: ‘back home in Central America people have heard that those who make it to American soil have a good chance of staying.’ The Obama administration may as well hang a sign saying ‘open’ across the U.S. border. Only when the President publicly and firmly declares that illegal immigration will no longer be tolerated will the crisis he created come to an end.  Unfortunately, it appears the President remains more interested in encouraging lawlessness than preventing it.”

"It is remarkable that on the same day the Labor Department announced 326,000 new applications for jobless benefits—an increase of 28,000 over last week—Majority Leader Reid would demand the House pass legislation to double the supply of new guest workers to fill jobs that unemployed Americans desperately need." – J.S.
Sen. Sessions continues the fight for Alabama’s steel workers and their communities, explaining that:  “‘Defending against artificially priced foreign imports is critical to having a functioning market that allows U.S. workers to compete,’ [Sen. Sessions said]. ‘Alabama has a robust steel industry that should not be unfairly damaged by foreign imports that skirt our trade rules.’”
Sen. Sessions made the following comments after joining a letter to the Commerce Department urging action be taken to blunt the improper and excess dumping of steel imports into the U.S. market:  “It is important that the Department of Commerce review the recent surge of tubular steel into the United States market. American-made steel that is used in the U.S. energy market accounts for roughly 10 percent of American steel production and helps employ thousands of workers. However, since 2008, imports have increased by over 60 percent. Such a sharp increase is troubling. Defending against artificially priced foreign imports is critical to having a functioning market that allows U.S. workers to compete. Alabama has a robust steel industry that should not be unfairly damaged by foreign imports that skirt our trade rules. I will closely monitor this review from the Department of Commerce to ensure proper valuation of imports and the proper protection of American workers.”

Earlier today Senator Sessions delivered a rebuttal to remarks from Senator Reid and Senator Schumer.   Reid and Schumer demanded that the House pass an immigration plan that would double the flow of new guest workers competing against jobless Americans.  Sessions vowed to keep fighting for struggling and forgotten US workers: "We are not going to be scared or intimidated into handing over control of our immigration laws to a small group of special interests."
Sen. Sessions: “We’re going to talk about what’s in the interest of the American people. We’re not going to talk about your politics and your ideology and your special interests; we’re going to talk about what’s good for America. And what’s good for America is to get more of our unemployed [people] working, to get more wages going up, rather than down.”
After hearing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony before the Budget Committee today, Ranking Member Sessions issued the following statement:  “Some would have us believe that a thriving workforce is just around the corner if we only keep spending and borrowing, keep interest rates low, and keep the stimulus pumping. Dr. Yellen seemed to suggest that things aren’t as bad as they seem, and that the benefits of this artificial stimulus have broadly benefited the American worker. But what is the reality? In 2011, the Fed predicted that growth in 2013 would be twice what it actually turned out to be. Indeed, their growth projections have consistently been too high. Since 2009—despite a record accumulation of debt, interest rates near zero, and a rapidly expanding Fed balance sheet—median household incomes have declined by a shocking $2,300. Since 2007, the population has grown by 15 million but half a million fewer people are employed.  American workers feel and sense, correctly, that something isn’t right: companies are not hiring them and their wages have fallen. They see the stock market rise and Washington spending soar, but their incomes shrink and their jobs prospects stall.  Not only did the Fed not avert the 2007 crisis, but its policies helped to foster it. And while the big firms were bailed out and the big spenders in Washington quickly frittered away a trillion dollars of borrowed stimulus, the American worker soldiered on in a weak economy. We can’t pump our way to prosperity—growth must be built on sound policies. We are not going to win the economic race by sinking our nation into permanent debt.  In order to succeed, we must put the American worker back to work. We need an ambitious plan to produce more American energy, keeping jobs and wealth right here in the U.S.; we need to make clear to our trading partners that we will defend U.S. workers from illicit trade practices; we need to outcompete other nations by reducing the tax and regulatory burden weighing down American industry and forcing companies to close their doors; we need an immigration policy that ensures open jobs go to unemployed American workers, not workers from abroad; we need to make government leaner, confronting every needless expenditure; and we need to restore stability and confidence in our future with an honest, balanced budget.”

Sen. Sessions issued the following comments today after the Administration moved unilaterally to issue an additional 100,000 work permits to guest workers:  “Yet again, the Administration is acting unilaterally to change immigration law in a way that hurts American workers. Fifty million working-age Americans aren’t working. Research shows as many as half of new technology jobs may be going to guest workers. Yet the Administration is now going to immediately add almost 100,000 new guest workers to compete against unemployed Americans—on top of the existing annual supply of approximately 700,000 guest workers and 1 million new permanent immigrant admissions. This will help corporations by further flooding a slack labor market, pulling down wages. It is good news for citizens in other countries who will be hired. But for struggling Americans, it will only reduce wages, lower job opportunities, and make it harder to scrape by. Who does the Administration represent?”

"The NYT report on the shrinking American middle class underscores once again that we have a surplus—not a shortage—of labor. The record immigration of the last 40 years, combined with the outsourcing of American manufacturing and the automation of many jobs, has placed substantial downward pressure on wages and employment: a recent study documented that all net employment gains in the U.S. from 2000-2013 went to immigrant workers, while real wages have dropped beneath 1999 levels. Yet President Obama and his congressional allies push for an unprecedented surge in new immigration. We need to rescue the American middle class, not hollow it out even further." – J.S.
Sen. Sessions responds to the WSJ report about the possibility of House immigration votes this summer:   “A weary public has begged and pleaded for years with their elected officials to end the lawlessness. But from their comfortable station in Washington, President Obama and congressional Democrats have ignored the public pleas. Instead, they have put their collective weight behind an immigration bill that delivers a sweeping amnesty for open borders groups and a huge guest worker surge for corporations. Now the Wall Street Journal reports that House GOP leaders are considering a plan to move an apparently similar immigration plan this summer.  At a time when trust in the President is at record lows, Republicans should not sacrifice their own credibility with such a maneuver. Such action would represent a colossal breach of the public trust: saying one thing before the primaries and then doing another thing after. Republican leaders must recognize that our party is now the last line of defense for American workers. We must proudly embrace this responsibility. Republicans must expose the harm the Administration has done—not join it in delivering a hammer blow to the middle class.”  BACKGROUND INFORMATION The white House / Senate bill would: grant work permits and amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants; double the future flow of temporary guest workers filling jobs in nearly every sector of the U.S. economy; and triple the grants of permanent legal status over the next decade to mostly-lesser skilled immigrants (from 10 million to more than 30 million green cards). The effect, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would be to reduce wages, reduce per capita GNP, and increase unemployment.
Ranking Member Sessions recently sent an oversight letter to the Small Business Administration asking a series of questions about its 7(a) loan guarantee program. He observed that "the guarantee takes a substantive risk away from the bank making the loan... and very well could provide incentives for some banks to cut corners through the underwriting process.

Ranking Member Sessions spoke today at a Budget Committee hearing about government policies that are harmful to working and out-of-work Americans, including a vast welfare bureaucracy with "no vision" and "no coherence." Sessions also pushed back on the calls from various special interests for a more open-borders immigration policy that would result in low wages and more guest workers, rather than rising wages and higher employment. Nearly all Congressional Democrats have endorsed a plan to double the flow of new guest workers.
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' remarks at the Budget Committee hearing this morning:   “We were told that the massive debts accumulated over the last five years would lead to prosperity. But we now are left with none of the prosperity and all of the debt… CBO says [interest payments on that debt] will rise in 2024 to $880 billion. That single year’s interest payment is 300 times what we spend today on our national parks. It’s 20 times what we spend today on our highways. It’s enough to fund our federal education programs for more than a decade…  If we care about economic growth, if we care about prosperity, then we must recognize that these rising interest payments threaten to drown our economy.”
Sen. Sessions commented today on the current state of immigration enforcement in light of new reports:  “The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in America has collapsed. Even those with criminal convictions are being released. DHS is a department in crisis. Secretary Johnson must reject the President’s demands to weaken enforcement further and tell him that his duty, and his officers’ duty, is to enforce the law—not break it. As Homeland Secretary, Mr. Johnson is tasked with ensuring the public safety and the rule of law. But Secretary Johnson is not meeting these duties.  American citizens have a legal and moral right to the protections our immigration laws afford—at the border, the interior and the workplace. The Administration has stripped these protections and adopted a government policy that encourages new arrivals to enter illegally or overstay visas by advertising immunity from future enforcement. Comments from top Administration officials, such as Attorney General Holder’s claim that amnesty is a civil right, or Vice President Biden’s claim that those here illegally are all U.S. citizens (apparently including someone whose visa expired yesterday), demonstrate the Administration’s increasing belief in an open borders policy the American public has always rejected.  The Administration’s lawless policies have not only impaired public safety but increased economic suffering for millions of vulnerable Americans by depriving them of their jobs and wages.  Unfortunately, Congressional Democrats continue to empower this lawlessness. Republicans must work to end it.”

Senator Sessions issued the following statement today on the passing of former U.S. Senator and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Jeremiah Denton:  “Jeremiah Denton was a friend, warrior, leader, and hero. The nation will never forget his courage when, having endured brutal torture as a POW in Vietnam, he defied and outsmarted his captors and broadcast a Morse code message to the world. He was a man of grit and character that can’t be manufactured. His word was his bond and his loyalty was unshakable.  Vietnam’s most ruthless interrogators couldn’t break the iron will of this rock-ribbed Alabama native. During his videotaped inquisition he declared: ‘whatever the position of my government is, I support it fully… and I will as long as I live.’ After being freed from the Vietnamese prison camp, before returning to home soil, he again displayed his abiding sense of duty, saying: ‘We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country under difficult circumstances. We are profoundly grateful to our Commander-in-Chief and to our nation for this day. God bless America.’  He also had a deep religious faith that helped inspire his service in the U.S. Senate. The city of Mobile, the state of Alabama, the Navy, and the Congress have all been honored to know him.  My wife, Mary, and I pray that his family will draw strength from the knowledge that his legacy will outlive us all.  May God bless him on his next journey.”
Congressional Budget Office: Interests payments on the federal debt to dwarf virtually every federal expense
ICYMI: Sen. Sessions released a detailed report yesterday on the Administration’s non-enforcement of immigration laws. The report concluded: “The Administration’s actions are breathtaking and without precedent. American citizens have both a legal and moral right to the protection our immigration laws afford; those rights have been systematically ignored, resulting in a massive loss of income and wages for the most vulnerable Americans. The Administration has abandoned its duty to faithfully execute the law and protect U.S. sovereignty, resulting not only in a collapse of immigration enforcement but a grave jeopardy to the American system of law and justice itself.”
Sen. Sessions released a report today exposing DHS’ unprecedented dismantling of immigration enforcement. You can view and share the report at the link below. Sessions’ comments on the report follow:  “The evidence reveals that the Administration has carried out a dramatic nullification of federal law. Under the guise of setting ‘priorities’, the Administration has determined that almost anyone in the world who can enter the United States is free to illegally live, work and claim benefits here as long as they are not caught committing a felony or other serious crime. This applies not only to illegal immigrants who entered through the border, but those who enter on a visa and overstay.  American workers and taxpayers are entitled to the protections our immigration laws afford, yet the Administration has suspended these protections, producing lower wages and higher unemployment.  Congressional Democrats have empowered this state of lawlessness. It falls on the shoulders of Republicans to reverse it—and to rescue the rule of law for the American people of today and tomorrow. More information will be shared in the coming days, in light of the administration’s call to expand these unlawful directives even further.”
Sen. Sessions made the following comments today on DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson’s meeting with various amnesty advocacy groups:  “It is shocking that the Department of Homeland Security, charged with enforcing our laws, would meet with amnesty groups to discuss ways to further defy and dismantle federal immigration law. Yet, Secretary Johnson has not met with his own ICE officers’ union and its courageous members who have spoken out to document the unlawful directives they are forced to follow. Mr. Johnson would do well to remember the oath he took to uphold the law.”

A key decision was made in the Commerce Department’s 8th Administrative review last year, rightly implementing Indonesia as the surrogate country, instead of Bangladesh, to ensure a proper baseline for fair pricing on catfish imports. Since 2008, imports of frozen fish fillets from Vietnam have more than tripled and significant portions of U.S. production have been heavily damaged by Vietnamese product that was unfairly dumped on the U.S. market without the same quality standards our domestic producers are required to meet. Under trade law, when a foreign competitor doesn’t have a recognized pricing standard because they are a government run economy, a surrogate country is selected for establishing pricing values. Before Indonesia was established as a surrogate country, instead of Bangladesh, enormous economic harm was done to this American industry. The Commerce Department correctly concluded Bangladesh was not a proper surrogate. It is essential that Indonesia remain a pricing surrogate to ensure that U.S. industry recovers and grows. I am closely watching this next Administrative review, which is expected soon, and am urging the Commerce Department to uphold their prior findings and ensure that fair pricing rules are properly applied to Vietnamese catfish.”
Last year the U.S. paid its creditors $221 billion in interest on its federal debt. Under the President’s plan, according to his own numbers, annual interest costs will reach $616 billion in 2020 while defense that year will be $583 billion. Annual interest payments will rise to $812 billion in FY 2024. That equals $424 in monthly interest costs for every American worker, or more than $5,000 per worker per year.
Sen. Sessions has an op-ed in the latest issue of National Review magazine outlining a pro-worker agenda for the GOP, including more domestic energy production, a revival of American manufacturing, and turning the welfare office into a job training center. Sessions’ op-ed also proposes that we pursue an immigration policy that will allow wages to rise.    Sessions wrote:  “The last 40 years have been a period of uninterrupted large-scale immigration into the U.S., coinciding with increased joblessness, falling wages, failing schools, and a growing welfare state. Would not the sensible, conservative thing to do be to slow down for a bit, allow wages to rise and assimilation to occur, and help the millions struggling here today — immigrant and native-born alike — transition from dependency to self-sufficiency?”
Sen. Sessions commented on the passing of Medal of Honor recipient, Col. Ola Lee Mize:  “Colonel Ola Lee Mize is a native of Marshall County and an American hero. He embodied the ideals of service and courage and made our state proud. He is perhaps best remembered by his defense of 'Outpost Harry' when it was attacked during the Korean War. Col. Mize bravely protected injured comrades and held opposition forces at bay, valiantly risking his life for others. For this intrepid gallantry, Col. Mize earned a Medal of Honor, which remains on display in the Guntersville Museum. Mary and I mourn his passing and send our condolences to his wife, Betty, and his family. Alabama has lost a true hero and his legend will grow. I was honored to get to know him. He was a remarkable man whose courage on the battlefield extended to a determination to do the right thing in all aspects of life.”
ICYMI: Here is a video excerpt of Sen. Sessions' comments earlier tonight siding with American workers and consumers over special interest groups pushing baseless energy restrictions:
Sen. Sessions is delivering remarks now on the unfounded push for climate and energy regulations that would hurt American workers. You can tune in here:
Sen. Sessions comments on today's jobs report:  “Since 2007, the population has grown by 15 million. Yet there are 1 million fewer Americans who are working. The result is a shrinking workforce and expanding welfare rolls. Even over the last year, there were 13 percent more workforce dropouts than job gains, and 1 in 5 households are now on food stamps. The economy has consistently produced too few jobs to keep up with population growth, and did so again this month, falling 20,000 shy of the 195,000 jobs just needed to stay even. This is now the 74 straight months beneath the employment levels at the beginning of the recession. The President’s plan to spend and borrow and add debt in order to revive the economy has proved to be one of the most costly failed gambits our nation has seen.  Government debt has increased 64 percent since 2009, from $10.6 trillion to $17.4 trillion. Yet, median household income has decreased 4.5 percent over that same time—that’s $2,268 per household, or $278 billion in total lost income.  Not only did this unprecedented accumulation of debt drain the nation of its wealth, but it failed to provide even the temporary benefit promised. Indeed, this massive build-up of debt has weakened growth and dampened job creation. Yet this week the President submitted another tax-and-spend budget that would add $8 trillion to our $17 trillion debt. He would add more than $1 trillion in taxes to an already weak economy, further growing Washington and shrinking the middle class.  Clearly, we must pursue a new course that creates jobs and that does not add to the debt. Here’s how: more American energy; a streamlined tax code; elimination of harmful regulations; a trade and immigration policy that serves American workers; making government leaner and more efficient; and a plan to balance the federal budget and restore confidence in the future.”
The Senate Judiciary Committee passes a bipartisan bill from Sen. Sessions to crack down on identity theft:
ICYMI: White House Budget Director refuses to answer question: Does your budget increase spending?
Today, the President's Budget Director testified before Congress about the President's proposal to increase discretionary spending yet again above the in-law limits.    Encourage everyone to watch this video of Senator Sessions, the Senate Budget Committee's Ranking Member, question the witness:
Sen. Sessions comments on President's budget:  “Just days ago the Director of the Congressional Budget Office sounded the alarm over our nation’s ‘unsustainable’ debt path and ‘the risk of a fiscal crisis.’ But President Obama has ignored the warning and submitted a budget plan that bursts through the Ryan-Murray spending caps he agreed to when signed them into law. With this proposal, the President has chosen not merely to disregard but to hide the dangers we face.  The President’s plan spends $791 billion above Ryan-Murray, casually wiping away the newly-established spending limits.  The President’s plan increases spending next year alone by $114 billion, including $56 billion in spending above the Ryan-Murray discretionary caps.  The President’s plan dramatically raises taxes by $1.76 trillion—double last year’s proposed tax hike. These astounding new taxes in reality will never happen, and provide a cover to mask the cost of the extraordinary new spending.  The President’s plan increases mandatory spending 78 percent and Medicare and Medicaid spending 73 percent, displaying not even the slightest care for—or offering any steps to prevent—the impending insolvency of these programs. Nor is any measure proposed to shore up Social Security.  The President’s plan adds $8.3 trillion to our nation’s gross federal debt.  The President’s plan is an open declaration that deficits don’t matter, debt doesn’t matter, and that reality itself doesn’t matter.  This profligacy has already inflicted an excruciating financial toll. Last year we paid our creditors $221 billion in interest on our federal debt. Under the President’s tax-and-spend plan, annual interest payments will rise to $812 billion. That’s $424 in monthly interest costs for every American worker, or more than $5,000 per worker per year. This money is not used for roads or bridges or schools—it must be used only to pay off our creditors, and has become the fastest growing item in the federal budget.  Annual interest costs in this budget will exceed our nation’s entire defense budget in just five years.  The President’s plan rejects the very idea of limits. It is the manifesto for a big government, tax-and-spend ideology. It will further grow the government, shrink the middle class, and shield the political elite from accountability as they raid the nation’s wealth.  As Washington prospers, workers suffer. The causes are clear: energy restrictions that destroy jobs; regulations that hamstring productivity; a health law that shrinks the workforce; a welfare policy that penalizes work; a trade policy that sends jobs overseas; an immigration policy that reduces wages; and a crushing tax and debt burden that drains our vitality and growth.  This budget betrays both our responsibility to Americans today—struggling to get by in this slow growth, high debt economy—and to our children, who will inherit perhaps the greatest debt any nation has ever accrued.”

Sen. Sessions comments on Remington’s expansion to Alabama:  "Remington's decision is great news and a further testament to the world class workforce in Huntsville. This plant will create good-paying manufacturing jobs for thousands of workers. We warmly welcome Remington Arms and look forward to their success and presence for years to come."
“The Senate voted 95-3 to repeal the 1 percent reduction in the annual cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, set to hit working-age military retirees at the end of 2015. [Senator] Sessions [who voted against the Ryan-Murray budget plan] said [it]  ‘unfairly and disproportionately’ targeted service members, retirees and veterans.  ‘After exposing how deep these cuts were - and the impact on disabled veterans - I pushed to have them reversed,’ Sessions said. ‘Fixing [the cuts to veterans’ pensions] is the right thing to do for our veterans.’  The pension cuts would save about $6 billion over the next 10 years. To offset that, Sessions and other Republicans were pushing for an amendment to close a tax credit loophole used by illegal immigrants… Sessions said he will continue the fight to close the tax loophole that costs the U.S. billions each year.”
Sen. Sessions joined 5 Senate colleagues in a letter sent to the IRS raising concerns about Obamacare enforcement. Their letter read in part: “Millions of Americans deeply resent how the [Affordable Care Act] raises the cost of their health care coverage, reduces their coverage options, and effectively dictates the type of coverage they must buy — and taxes them if they do not buy it. Certainly, in the coming months many Americans will also have strong feelings about how the IRS enforces the individual mandate tax.”

Sen. Sessions comments on his legislative efforts to aid Veterans and unemployed workers: "I have filed two amendments to the unemployment bill that would protect our veterans as well as struggling American workers. The first amendment reverses the unfair cuts to military pensions for all current veterans and servicemembers, and is paid for by closing a tax welfare loophole that allows illegal aliens to claim credits to which they are not legally entitled.  My second amendment would require that businesses looking to hire new workers be required to use the simple online E-Verify tool to verify that their employees are in the country legally. If Congress is serious about helping jobless Americans, including minority workers who have seen their wages and job opportunities eroded in recent years by illegal immigration, then this commonsense measure should be adopted without delay.”

"'[Sen.] Sessions has proposed closing the immigration loophole to offset the some $6 billion in savings from the retirement cuts. That proposal, which has not been allowed to move ahead for a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate, is one of several efforts to immediately repeal the pension change...  'Our military service members answered the call of duty without hesitation. We owe them swift, diligent action to fix these unfair cuts with smarter and more intelligent offsets like those that have been proposed... This would be the definition of common sense.'"
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' statement today:  "The White House and Senate Democrats have embraced a plan that not only allows illegal immigration to continue indefinitely, but proposes to double the flow of new legal immigrant workers and triple the number of mostly lesser-skilled immigrants who will be given green cards. Unfortunately, it seems several House leaders are contemplating a similar approach. We need to move Americans off of welfare and into good-paying jobs—not replace them with lower-wage workers from abroad. Gene Sperling has said there are three jobseekers for every one job opening.  Has anyone asked the American people whether they want these large increases to current record immigration levels now being proposed?  Lawmakers must decide who they represent: immigration activists and powerful interests, or millions of struggling and unemployed Americans. Republicans have an opportunity to stand alone as the one party dutifully representing the legitimate interests of the American worker. They should seize it. They should boldly and unapologetically articulate policies that end the lawlessness and advance the national interest.”
Sen. Sessions responded this evening to the House GOP leaders' "immigration principles" by making the following comments:  "Once again, we have the same recycled talking points—crafted, it would appear, with the help of the same consultants and special interests. Each time, the talking points are followed by legislation that fails to match the promises—legislation that, at bottom, ensures only the amnesty and not the enforcement. The leadership talking points look like an attempted repackaging of the tired Gang-of-Eight-style formula that has been proposed, rejected, and re-proposed for years. It is no surprise then that Senator Schumer and former Speaker Pelosi are so encouraged by these developments. But while Democrat leaders and interest groups appear satisfied, this document was not voted upon by the GOP conference and clearly does not represent the consensus of Republican members. Is it not time we pushed aside the stale proposals stitched together in concert with the same lobbyists, and asked what is in the best interests of the hardworking American citizen—and the nation?  In three fundamental respects, the House leaders’ emerging immigration proposal appears to resemble the Senate plan: it provides the initial grant of amnesty before enforcement; it would surge the already unprecedented level of legal lesser-skilled immigration to the U.S. that is reducing wages and increasing unemployment; and it would offer eventual citizenship to a large number of illegal immigrants and visa overstays.  Rank-and-file House Republicans are the last line of defense for working Americans. Now is the time for rank-and-file House Republicans to claim the leadership mantle and to say, firmly: our goal is to transition millions of struggling Americans from welfare and joblessness to work and rising wages. The President has not only dismantled enforcement but has delivered for a small group of special interests and CEOs by forcing through the Senate legislation that drastically surges the future flow of new immigrant workers competing against unemployed Americans. There is a reason why these increases are never mentioned in the slick TV ads and radio spots: the American people reject them. Americans earning under $30,000 prefer a reduction to an increase in current record immigration levels by a 3-1 margin. Republicans have the chance to be the one party giving voice to the real-world concerns of the everyday worker whose wages have been flat or falling for more than 10 years.  House leaders should support—not ignore—the immigration officers pleading for help. They should stand with—not against—unemployed American workers. And they should expose—not join—the President’s campaign to pass an immigration plan that will hollow out our shrinking middle class."
Here's a link to the immigration packet Sen. Sessions put together as House Republicans prepare to debate "immigration principles." Folks are encouraged to read, share, and distribute the important information it contains.
Sen. Sessions comments on the President's State of the Union address:  “President Obama says he is concerned about low wages and chronic unemployment for American workers. Yet his signature second-term legislative item is an immigration bill that would immediately and permanently double the flow of new immigrant workers competing against unemployed Americans—reducing wages, increasing unemployment, and further shrinking the middle class. Experts tell us that the current, very high immigration flow is already a factor in declining wages.   His other policy proposals—more government spending, public assistance, and wage controls—are a continued attempt to deal with the symptoms of an economy that is failing and stagnant, rather than with the causes. This agenda will not only do little for those it is designed to assist in the short run, but will actually do harm to many in the long run.  With a record 1 in 5 households on food stamps, and with 92 million Americans outside the work force, it is clear what we must do: a focused national effort to help transition millions of Americans off of welfare, off of unemployment, and into good-paying jobs. This must be done without adding to the debt. Such an effort would include more American energy; better trade and immigration enforcement; welfare and tax reform; a leaner, more productive government; the elimination of regulations that destroy jobs; and the growth and confidence created by balancing the federal budget.”

Excerpt from Sen. Sessions Monday op-ed in USA today urging the House GOP not to capitulate to the President's immigration push:  "With three job seekers for every open job, [the president] proposes doubling the number of guest workers entering every year, granting immediate work permits to millions of illegal immigrants, and tripling the number of new immigrants granted permanent residency over the next decade...The choice is clear. Either the GOP can help the White House deliver a crushing hammer blow to the middle class — or it can stand alone as the one party defending the legitimate interests of American workers."

ICYMI: Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' friday statement on House leaders' drafting 'immigration principles': "House Republican leaders must dismiss the whispers of the consultant class, the pleadings of the business lobby, and the pressure campaign from the activists who believe illegal immigration is a civil right...Instead, the GOP must embrace the national interest: placing its first emphasis on helping millions of Americans transition from welfare and unemployment to work and rising wages...The House now stands alone as the last line of defense for millions of working Americans that form the backbone of the nation"
Sen. Sessions released the following statement after news reports on House leaders' effort to draft ‘immigration principles’ for the GOP:  “President Obama and Senate Democrats have uniformly embraced an immigration plan that would devastate wages and working conditions for millions of struggling Americans to benefit a small cadre of lobbyists and CEOs. The proposal they created doubles the flow of immigrant workers, adds another 30 million new permanent residents to compete for every job, and guarantees illegal immigration will continue permanently in the future. House Republican leaders must dismiss the whispers of the consultant class, the pleadings of the business lobby, and the pressure campaign from the activists who believe illegal immigration is a civil right. It would be tragic if the Leader's immigration principles were simply a ‘piecemeal’ repackaging of the Senate plan.  Instead, the GOP must embrace the national interest: placing its first emphasis on helping millions of Americans transition from welfare and unemployment to work and rising wages. In so doing, the GOP will not only aid struggling workers from all backgrounds, but will recapture the trust and faith of millions of Americans who have turned away from the party. Such clear and convicted action would also expose the influence special interests groups have wielded over the White House and Senate Democrats from day one. The House now stands alone as the last line of defense for millions of working Americans that form the backbone of the nation.  A sound immigration plan will help both citizens and immigrants alike—reducing unemployment, promoting assimilation into the middle class, and ensuring the consistent and faithful application of the law upon which our national greatness depends.”

Today, Sen. Sessions questioned EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on her proposed climate regulations that would cost millions of jobs and billions of dollars. Sessions pressed McCarthy on the President’s claims of unexpected warming, and she was unable to support those claims—yet continued pushing for administrative action that would hurt U.S. workers. See the exchange below:
Sen. Sessions just filed an amendment to the omnibus to fix the pensions for all veterans by closing a loophole used to pay billions in free tax credits to illegal immigrants. Sessions previously put forward this amendment and it was blocked by Majority Leader Reid and his Senate Majority Conference. Click below to see video of the Majority arguing that the payments to illegal immigrants should continue, despite the Inspector General for Tax Administration imploring Congress to close the loophole.
After Sen. Sessions uncovered the fact that wounded warriors’ pensions were cut in the Ryan-Murray spending package and led the effort to undo them, those pension payments for wounded warriors were restored in the current spending bill. However, it retains the cuts for the vast majority of veterans and service members’ pensions, prompting Sessions to continue his efforts to ensure fairness for all our veterans. Sen. Sessions has proposed an amendment that would restore pension funding for military personnel by removing billions in free tax credits for individuals illegal present in the U.S. Majority Leader Harry Reid and his conference continue to block the fix in the Senate.
Sen. Sessions:  “Three people are looking for every one job open and [yet] the President embraced an immigration bill that would double the flow of guest workers… We need to help struggling Americans get off of welfare, off of unemployment, and into good-paying jobs.  Byron York recently wrote an excellent column showing that the same companies signing letters demanding more guest workers are laying off American workers by the thousands.  Who do we work for?  I know who I work for, and it’s the hardworking people of Alabama—it’s not these ‘masters of the universe’ demanding more workers from Congress when millions of Americans are unemployed.  America is not an oligarchy. House Republicans need to tell the President firmly: we work for the American people. We reject any immigration plan that puts special interests before working Americans. We are going to defend the working people of this country.  A small group of CEOs does not get to set immigration policy for our country. We will not enrich the political class at the expense of the middle class.”
Sen. Sessions issued the following statement today on the December jobs report:   “Today’s jobs report underscores a deeper problem facing our economy: a large and growing block of people who are chronically jobless and completely outside the workforce.  In December, the economy added only 74,000 jobs – not nearly enough to keep up with population growth –and 347,000 left the workforce.  That means for every one job added, nearly 5 people left the workforce entirely.  There are now nearly 92 million Americans outside the workforce, resulting in the lowest participation rate in 36 years.  The President’s immigration plan will only make things dramatically worse – and no amount of ‘promise zones’ will be a sufficient remedy for the millions of displaced workers.   We must help people move off of welfare, off of unemployment, and into good-paying jobs that can support a family.  More tax, spend, borrow and regulate will only produce more joblessness, dependency and debt.  Instead, we need more American energy, streamlined taxes and regulations, a leaner and less wasteful government, better trade and immigration enforcement, and a reformed welfare system that helps struggling Americans realize the dream of financial independence.”
Today, Sen. Sessions filed an amendment to the unemployment bill that would verify whether workers were lawfully or unlawfully present in the county.  Sessions appealed to the Majority Leader to stop blocking consideration of amendments and to allow it to come to a vote on behalf of all American workers.
Here is the text of Sen. Sessions' response to the President's announced "promise zones":   “The President today announced five ‘promise zones’ scattered throughout the entirety of the nation for the millions of chronically unemployed Americans. It represents an admission that five years of tax, spend, borrow, and regulate have produced economic misery for countless Americans. His policies are growing the government and shrinking the middle class. Since the President declared the end of the recession, conditions for working Americans have not improved. Surely the President does not believe the five ‘promise zones’ are a sufficient remedy when 91.5 million Americans are outside the workforce. As his own economic advisor said, there are three people looking for every one job available.  Yet what is the President’s top second-term priority? Is it a plan to help Americans on unemployment and welfare find good-paying jobs? No, the top priority remains an immigration bill crafted by CEOs that will double the flow of new workers from abroad to compete in every industry and sector throughout the U.S. economy. If the President succeeds in pushing through the House his plan to take jobs needed by Americans, he will have to create many more ‘promise zones’ for the millions of displaced workers.”
Sen. Sessions released this statement today in response to the President's speech on chronic unemployment.

Sen. Sessions spoke on the Senate floor yesterday to offer ideas to help struggling workers find good-paying jobs:  Energy: “The Administration has blocked American energy. They have dragged their feet in every shape, form, and fashion, whether it is moratoriums in the gulf or blocking in Alaska, blocking the pipeline for our neighbors in Canada, or blocking production on public lands. This is not the way to create an economy.”  Trade: “We need to stand up for American workers and American manufacturing on the world stage. It is time to tell our trading partners: ‘We are willing to trade with you… but you have to play by the rules.’”  Immigration: “We admit a million [people] a year legally. We believe in immigration, we support immigration, but at some point you are bringing in workers to take jobs from unemployed Americans. So now we are here trying to extend unemployment benefits to help unemployed Americans. Is there no common sense in this body? How can this possibly be?”  Taxes and Federal Regulations: “We need a tax system that is not always going up but is more growth-oriented, simpler, more focused on creating growth. We need to eliminate every unnecessary regulation that burdens the American competitive marketplace and makes us less competitive globally instead of adding to them, and we have never seen anything like the plethora of new regulations being issued day after day, week after week, month after month, many of them challengeable constitutionally as being beyond the power of bureaucrats to issue…”  Debt: “Our debt is so large—$17-plus trillion—now that it is causing uncertainty in the economic markets. We have to get our spending under control… The unemployment bill that is before us today makes no attempt whatsoever to find spending reductions in other areas of this monstrosity of a government, but borrows every penny of it.”
Sen. Sessions voted in opposition to the nomination of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve Chairman. She was confirmed this evening 56-26.
Sen. Sessions is speaking on the Senate floor NOW about the U.S. economy and the need to get Americans back to work: "An unemployment extension bill is [only] treating the symptoms of the problem. It's an aspirin for a fever, but the fever has been raging for weeks now. Something is causing it, and we need to deal with the cause of it rather than continuing to treat the symptoms."
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' article: “We are in the midst of an unprecedented period of uninterrupted levels of high immigration, coinciding with falling wages, declining work-force participation, and expanding welfare rolls. Yet ‘immigration reform’ somehow remains a euphemism for the tired formula of combining an indiscriminate amnesty with a massive surge in new workers from abroad…  The RNC should demand that the president and Senate Democrats justify their embrace of a bill that would double the flow of immigrant workers when a record 91.5 million Americans are outside the labor force… Is our goal just to do ‘something,’ or to do the right thing?”
Sen. Sessions expressed his concerns on the Senate floor last night that the rights of all Senators' were being eroded, and urged members of both parties to defend the historic role of the Senate as a Chamber as the place where the great issues of our time are brought before the nation for thorough amendment and debate.

Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' statement following final passage of the Ryan-Murray spending package:  "Majority Leader Reid rushed through this closed-door deal without a single amendment. His conference blocked my amendment, for instance, to replace pension cuts for wounded warriors with the closure of a tax welfare loophole.  At present we are left with a tax-and-spend plan that also removes a procedural tool to prevent Democrats from exceeding spending limits and raising taxes again in the future.”
Sen. Sessions: “What justification can be given to the concept that duly elected United States Senators can’t stand up on the floor of this body and defend the rights of their constituents and their states by offering amendments to improve legislation?”

Sen. Sessions made the following statement after Maj. Leader Reid and his conference voted to block Senators from offering amendments to the budget deal. Sessions made a procedural move to force a vote of the entire Senate:  “Today, Reid and his majority quashed the ability of any Senator to offer amendments to the spending deal that emerged from the House. They voted to undermine their own ability as Senators to offer amendments and do legislative work in the clear light of day. They voted to block the Senate from working to improve this tax-and-spend deal. Finally, by blocking my amendment, they voted to cut pensions for wounded warriors. Senators in this chamber have many valid ideas for replacing these pension cuts, including my proposal to close the tax welfare loophole for illegal filers, and all deserved a fair and open hearing. But they were denied.”

Earlier, Sen.

Excerpt from AL.com article on Sen. Sessions’ efforts to protect the victims of child abuse:  "‘As a former prosecutor and Attorney General, I have seen firsthand the dramatic impact that children's advocacy centers have made in improving our nation's response to these terrible crimes,’ Sessions said in a statement today. ‘Since the Victims of Child Abuse Act was introduced more than two decades ago, we have seen substantial improvements in the investigation of these heinous acts and the vital care provided to child victims. Protecting our children is the highest moral duty we have. I am proud that the first Children's Advocacy Center is in Huntsville--this amazing organization does such crucial work on behalf of our nation's children...   The Victims of Child Abuse Act plays a critical role in protecting our nation's children and we must reauthorize it.’”
Sen. Sessions commented on Alabama’s proposal to build the Boeing 777x jetliner in Huntsville:  “I am pleased to hear that Governor Bentley has submitted Alabama’s proposal to build the Boeing 777x jetliner in Huntsville. Huntsville has an exceptional workforce and is rightfully on Boeing’s short list of destinations. The Huntsville region is already a leader in our nation’s defense and has the capable engineers, analysts, and production workers necessary to be a world renowned center for aerospace aviation. Boeing has a solid foundation and established partnership in Huntsville and I am proud of the hard work by state and local officials to push for the 777x facility which will reportedly add 8,500 jobs and serve as an important pillar of the economy in north Alabama.”
Sen. Sessions toured the Commercial Jet Services facility in Dothan:  “Alabama is my state. I represent the people of Alabama and we want to see economic growth and prosperity. The local leaders here have banded together to try to create the climate that will attract good investment.”
Sen. Sessions responded to the President’s speech on the deteriorating conditions facing working Americans. Sessions pointed out that the President has been meeting with a small group of CEOs to craft an immigration plan that would displace U.S. workers:  “It is shocking for the President to give a speech about income disparity and falling wages while pushing an immigration plan that will hammer American workers and widen the disparity. The Congressional Budget Office confirms the White House-backed plan would reduce wages, reduce per capita GNP, and increase unemployment. The President says people are worried ‘the system is rigged’ and yet it is the President who has teamed up with a small cadre of CEOs to double the flow of immigrant workers when these exact same companies are laying off American workers in droves.   Wages for American workers are lower today than they were more than a decade ago—and take-home pay has fallen each year since the President came into office. A recent study demonstrated that all net job growth since 2000 has gone to immigrant workers while the number of U.S.-born Americans working has declined by 1.3 million.   The President’s policies also threaten college students who are about to enter a difficult economy. His plan would more than double the number of temporary foreign workers for wealthy tech companies. As Professor Ron Hira, a leading expert on H-1B visas, has noted, the visas are being used for ‘facilitating offshoring and providing employers with cheap, temporary labor—while reducing job opportunities for American high-tech workers in the process.’   Harvard professor Dr. George Borjas found that high levels of immigration between 1980 and 2000 caused the wages of lower-skilled American workers to drop nearly 8 percent. He also found current immigration levels have resulted in a $402 billion annual wage loss for workers but a $437 billion increase in profits for business owners.   It is time to have an open and honest conversation about our shrinking middle class and the consequences of our immigration policies on American workers and their wages. Unfortunately, that is not what we got from the President today.   The truth is that the policy formula favored by President Obama—more regulation, hostility to American energy, anti-growth taxation, surging debt, bigger government, more federal interference, government-run healthcare, and mindless immigration policies—are the cause, not the cure, for growing middle class distress.”

Sen. Sessions Joins Bipartisan Letter To Department Of Commerce regarding antidumping orders on foreign steel:
Sessions responds to President's immigration speech today:   “House leaders must lay out clearly to the American people the President’s dismal record on immigration. During his time in office, the President has systematically dismantled interior enforcement, handcuffing immigration officers and bypassing Congress. These facts—drawn from the testimony from immigration officers themselves—should be clearly documented before the whole nation. No agreement should be entered into while such lawlessness continues.  Secondly, the President must be asked—by media and lawmakers alike—how he can possibly justify a plan that will double the flow of immigrant workers at a time when 91.5 million Americans are outside the labor force? Indeed, as the President makes his immigration remarks he is preparing to hold a fundraiser with Silicon Valley executives, a group clamoring for more guest workers at a time when nearly half of recent college grads are underemployed. Wages are flat and falling for U.S. workers—the clearest evidence that there is not a labor shortage, but a jobs shortage.  America is not an oligarchy. Congressional leaders must forcefully reject the notion, evidently accepted by the President, that a small cadre of CEOs can tailor the nation’s entire immigration policy to suit their narrow interests. A Republic must answer to the people.”

Sessions: “We have this spectacle of members of the United States Senate, United States Senators from great states all over America, hat in hand bowing before the Majority Leader, pleading that he allow them to have their amendment up for a vote. And it’s really not right. It is an alteration of the whole concept of the free and open debate the Senate is all about. I truly believe that it is. And we’re going to have to stop it.”

Breitbart News quoted Senator Sessions’ response yesterday to the President on immigration:   “‘House members need to be on alert: it’s not step-by-step if the individual bills are combined into a comprehensive proposal in a backroom negotiation and delivered to the President’s desk… Instead, the House must insist that enforcement is accomplished before advancing any other immigration bills.’”  The story went on to explain: “Obama [in his remarks] did not mention the fact that the Congressional Budget Office determined that comprehensive immigration reform would lower the wages of working class Americans while he touted the economic benefits for big corporations. House Republican leaders have indicated they would not go to conference on the exact Senate bill, and Obama's words indicate passing significant provisions of the Senate's bill in a ‘piecemeal’ way may be a way that proponents of immigration reform will attempt to pass the Senate bill without saying they did so in a ‘comprehensive’ manner.”  “Sessions also said the Obama administration ‘is in a state of open defiance of federal immigration law’ and House ‘members should tell the President: your immigration bill will dramatically surge permanent low-skill immigration at a time when 91.5 million Americans are outside the labor force… We need to be helping Americans get off of welfare, off of unemployment and into good-paying jobs.’”
The tech giant lobbying group, FWD.us, has launched a nationwide ad campaign arguing for ‘immigration reform.’ What you won’t hear from these companies is that the ‘reform’ they have in mind is doubling the number of guest workers who are brought in each year just to fill jobs—despite high unemployment. A recent article in Computerworld quoted Tufts Professor Karen Panetta warning that ‘students will face increasing competition from lower-wage H-1B workers if the federal cap on visas rises.’ Rutgers Professor Sal Hazman warned that those under 30 will be especially hard hit. And Ron Hira, a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, was quoted in the same article as explaining that these visas are being ‘used very extensively for cheap labor.’ Congress should resist the pressure from these special interests and President Obama and intensify our effort to get unemployed American workers—high and low-skilled—into these jobs.   -J.S.
Sen. Sessions sent a letter today to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew regarding tax credits provided to SolarCity, a solar energy company that has lost over $300 million since 2008, warning of the possibility that the company could become the next Solyndra. Here is an excerpt from the letter:   “The financial pressures related to a private company’s survival should not cause the federal government to modify its policies or place additional taxpayer money at risk… There is concern that SolarCity might become the next Solyndra—a company propped on the back of the taxpayers.”
Today, Chuck Spurlock, Sen. Sessions' longtime friend and State Director of 17 years passed away. Sessions released the following statement on the passing of Chuck, a man beloved and admired by people across the state:  “I am heartbroken over the passing of my friend and State Director, Chuck Spurlock. Chuck loved life, had high ethical and moral standards, and always reflected the best qualities of public service. He was a loyal patriot and a truly loyal friend and confidant. We spent countless hours driving the state, often into the night, talking together. He was the first person named to my Senate staff.   Chuck was one of the most knowledgeable people, perhaps the most knowledgeable person concerning politics and government in Alabama over the past 25 years. Members of our delegation in Congress, friends, office holders, and candidates throughout Alabama regularly sought his opinion and insight. His judgment was highly favored.   He loved the practical aspects of politics while being an historian and intellectual. The state staff he supervised loved him and he loved them and was constantly supportive of their work.     Chuck loved his family dearly and they him. The constant support, encouragement, and affection Phyllis and the children showed him during this difficult time was inspiring to us all. I join Chuck’s friends across every corner of Alabama mourning the passing of a great man.”
Senator Sessions made the following comments today after Speaker Boehner said he would not conference with the Senate immigration bill.  Sessions praised the announcement while also sounding a note of caution:  “Today’s announcement is an important and positive development for our nation, our people, and the Republican party. House Republicans are resisting an influence campaign and standing for the interests of the American people.  But a word of caution: the groups pushing for Gang of Eight-style legislation are well-financed and very powerful. The Gang of Eight bill’s fatal flaw was always that it answered to the special interests at the expense of the national interest. Arguably the single most destructive feature of the Senate’s immigration bill was the massive permanent surge in low-skill immigration that would reduce wages and increase unemployment. The White House and Senate Democrats shamelessly coordinated with a small cadre of CEOs to pressure House Republicans to yield.  It’s time for Republicans to tell these special interests to get lost and to be the one party that will defend the interests of the millions of low-wage Americans looking for better jobs and better wages. This is the moment for a vision to emerge centered on growth and prosperity for working Americans—not just the powerful and well-connected.”
The budget conference committee held its second public meeting this morning. Excerpts from Sen. Sessions' prepared remarks:  "I would submit to this conference committee that the evidence is beyond doubt: our nation’s current and future budget problems are the consequence of unsustainable spending levels...  The President says the problem is with the American people. They must send more money. But, Washington has no right to ask taxpayers for a single additional dollar as long as this waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars continues. This committee has an opportunity to restore the people’s trust in Congress by identifying ways to make government leaner, less wasteful, and more accountable. Would that not be a moral good—indeed, a moral imperative?"
Sen. Sessions will be on the Bill Bennett radio show this morning at about 8:05 ET to discuss immigration with guest host Peter Kirsanow of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Sessions and Kirsanow will address how the White House immigration plan would harm U.S. workers. Click to listen live.
"Analyses of the Senate's 'Gang of Eight' bill show that the legislation would add 30 million additional immigrants to the United States over the next decade, at a time when the number of Americans not in the labor force has reached record highs... Experts say adding millions more to the labor force would harm working class Americans by taking away jobs and lowering wages. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated wages would decline by 0.1 percent in the first decade...  'First thing to keep in mind is it's not a good time to push through anything even remotely resembling the Gang of Eight bill,' said Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, in an interview. 'Even in a roaring economy it would be a spectacularly bad idea.'"
"On Veterans Day, our nation pauses to honor the millions of Americans who have served their country and defended its people. Each generation, these brave souls have risen to answer the call. Alabama has a long, distinguished tradition of military service and is home to many of our nation's greatest heroes. Last night, in Birmingham, I was humbled to present an award to the Tuskegee Airmen, whose tremendous courage in the face of adversity is a lasting inspiration to all of us. Today, in Huntsville, I was privileged to participate in a breakfast and parade to honor the contribution of all who served. God bless our veterans, their families, and our country."  -J.S.

Senator Sessions organized a group of Senators urging the House-Senate farm bill conference to hold foreign imported catfish to the same inspection standards as domestic catfish farmers.

Excerpt from Ranking Member Sessions' opening statement at today's budget conference meeting:  "For the past five years, we have had record deficits. This was the Democratic vision for restoring vigorous growth and lasting prosperity... It has not worked. Never has so great a sum been spent for so little in return: • Take-home pay has fallen for each of the last five years • Median household income is lower today than at any time since 1996 • The labor force dropout rate is the highest it’s been since 1945 • We have the lowest labor force participation rate in 35 years • We have 12 million more residents than we did in 2007 but 2 million fewer workers  What we should do is create a growth-oriented tax system that makes America more competitive, eliminate unnecessary regulations, produce more American energy, ensure fair trade so our workers can fairly compete, enforce an immigration policy that serves our national interest, reject large government programs that kill jobs, and balance the budget to restore confidence in the future of America.  These are common-sense proposals that will work. These ideas are consistent with the American ideals that have served us so well."

ICYMI: Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' statement on immigration policy: "The Senate bill would double the number of guest workers at a time when a record 90 million Americans are outside the work force. We need to get Americans off of unemployment, off of welfare, and back into the labor force — but the ‘reforms’ proposed by the Senate would put even more Americans out of work.   Many of the same CEOs demanding that Congress increase guest workers are laying off thousands of American workers. This is a defining moment for the House Republicans. They must decide who they represent: certain activist CEOs lobbying Congress, or the national interest and the millions of Americans struggling to get by in this low job, low wage economy."
"The NEH and its grant program are the subject of a letter released Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee's top Republican, Sen.

Sen. Sessions made the following comments today following the President’s address on immigration. Sessions emphasized the need to help struggling U.S. workers:  “The President said he has not heard any good reason to oppose the Senate bill. Clearly, he has not listened to the ICE and USCIS officers warning that the bill would permanently undermine enforcement. Here are three more reasons: the Senate bill will lower wages, increase unemployment, and reduce per-capita GNP. All of these statements are confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office. Under current law, we will provide approximately 10 million grants of permanent residency (green cards) over the next decade. Under the Senate bill, that number will triple to more than 30 million. Further, the Senate bill would double the number of guest workers at a time when a record 90 million Americans are outside the work force. We need to get Americans off of unemployment, off of welfare, and back into the labor force—but the ‘reforms’ proposed by the Senate would put even more Americans out of work. Many of the same CEOs demanding that Congress increase guest workers are laying off thousands of American workers.    This is a defining moment for the House Republicans. They must decide who they represent: certain activist CEOs lobbying Congress, or the national interest and the millions of Americans struggling to get by in this low job, low wage economy.”
Budget Committee Ranking Member Jeff Sessions released a new report today that revealed that the federal government has spent $3.7 trillion on means-tested welfare and poverty programs since President Obama took office—nearly 5 times greater than the amount spent over that time on NASA, education, and all transportation projects combined.
Sen. Sessions issued a statement on the new jobs numbers released today:  “Today’s jobs report underscores the real problem in today’s labor market: growing joblessness among working-age adults despite modest monthly gains in total employment.  Nearly 2 million fewer Americans are working today than in 2007. But this does not tell the full story: millions more have left the workforce altogether—retiring early, moving in with family, going from a two-income to a one-income household, going on disability or welfare, or giving up looking for work. Of particular concern is that 1 in 6 American youth are neither working or in school.  Taking into account all of this, less than 60 percent of U.S. adults are participating in the workforce. Worse still, the broad measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and marginal workers actually increased to 13.6 percent last month. This joblessness translates into 3.7 billion fewer hours being worked this year than in 2007, which directly affects the savings and living standards of millions of Americans. Those who are working are experiencing a decline in wages and incomes stretching back to the late 1990s. Getting these Americans back into the workforce, and getting cash wages to rise and replace government benefits, has to be at the center of all economic discussions.”

Earlier today, Sen. Sessions issued a statement on the Department of Homeland Security. Here is some additional background information:  Background:   · The ICE officers’ association reports that they are “currently forced to apply [the President’s] DREAMer orders to detainees in prisons and jails,” and that “violent criminals are released every day back into communities.” USCIS adjudications officers report that they are under “pressure to rubber-stamp applications,” and “have become an approval machine.”   · Reports from border patrol officers that illegal alien assaults against agents, as well as unlawful actions to impede agents in their duties, are not being prosecuted.   · Research from the Senate Budget, Finance and Agriculture committee minority offices demonstrate that federal in-law welfare restrictions for non-citizens have been ignored by DHS.
Sen. Sessions statement on DHS nominee:  “ICE officers report that ‘violent criminals are released every day back into communities,’ and they even sued the DHS Secretary herself over the non-enforcement directives they have received. USCIS caseworkers report that they are being forced to ‘rubber stamp’ immigration applications. Enforcement has collapsed, officer morale has plummeted, and the integrity of the entire immigration legal system is in jeopardy.   Mr. Johnson will have to demonstrate the following to the Senate: • A commitment to achieving management control of this sprawling department and its law enforcement duties. • A determination to restore the depleted morale of immigration officers who have been blocked from doing their jobs. • A resolve to enforce the laws of the land, and a repudiation of the far-reaching non-enforcement protocols issued by the prior DHS Secretary.   This nomination should focus the attention of the Congress and the country on the open refusal of DHS political appointees to impartially execute their law enforcement mission.”
Excerpt from the Daily Caller article on ICE Officers reporting abuses at DHS:  "'Officers are currently forced to apply his DREAMer orders to detainees in prisons and jails,' [ICE Officers’ National Council President Chris Crane] said… He further lamented that while ICE officers requested a meeting with Obama eight months ago, they still have yet to meet — even as the president have met with big labor, big business and pro-amnesty activist groups...  'All over the country, Americans are struggling to find work,' [Sen. Sessions] said. 'It is unthinkable that the President would continue to lobby Congress on behalf of special interests in order to double the flow of immigrant workers into the country, as bills in both the House and Senate propose.'"
Sen. Sessions issued the following statement after voting 'no' tonight on the debt hike / spending bill.  Sessions argues that Washington must not 'pivot' to the next issue, but serve working Americans who are being squeezed out of the middle class:  “In the last five years, Washington spent more than $15 trillion and added more than $6 trillion to the debt. Never has so great a sum been spent for so little in return. Despite this huge stimulus spending, wages are lower than in 1999 and nearly 60 million working-age Americans aren’t working. Fewer people are employed today than in 2007.    But Leader Reid and the White House have adopted the extreme stance that there is to be no change in policy to help the millions of Americans being squeezed out of the middle class.  They demanded yet another increase in the debt limit – without cutting one single penny of spending. They demanded the unfettered implementation of Obamacare – a law that will add $6 trillion to the long-term debt while causing millions of hardworking people to lose their jobs and health plans, forced into part-time work that can’t support a family. And they even demanded that we spend above the Budget Control Act – a transparent effort to permanently bust federal spending caps.    Now is not the time to pivot to the next issue. We’ll hit a new debt limit next year. We must stay focused on the central issue. With falling wages, $1 trillion in welfare spending, and a massive health law that no one can afford, now is the time to pursue a national reform agenda that serves working Americans. Struggling workers deserve a sound financial future – one with better wages, better incomes, and a better plan than borrowing money to mail more government checks.”
"It is a sad reflection on Washington that our National Mall has been closed to our nation’s citizens but was opened – at taxpayers' expense – for unlawful immigrants and open borders advocates.  This calls to mind the President’s recent decision to shut down White House tours, and to refuse a meeting with ICE officers, but to invite illegal immigrants for a policy discussion in the Oval Office.  Priorities are indeed misaligned when the President and House lawmakers are pushing an immigration bill that would surge the number of guest workers and reduce wages for struggling Americans."  -- J.S.
Sen. Sessions, who serves as Ranking Member on the Budget Committee, made the following comments today about the selection of Janet Yellen to head the Federal Reserve:   “I intend to fairly but rigorously scrutinize this nominee.  What we need in the Fed is a policy of humility that recognizes its limitations and the risk of continued easing.  The idea that the Fed has the insight to micromanage the economy, taming bubbles with targeted precision was demolished after they not only failed to see but contributed to the last financial bubble.   And while Fed policy has aided large and sophisticated investors who capitalize on low borrowing rates it has squeezed the middle class and working Americans who prudently save their money.  The stimulus mindset in Washington – both fiscal and monetary – has not produced strong, sustainable growth.  Cash pay for wage earners has declined while Wall Street has been enriched and the size of government has soared.  Our nation’s long-term plan surely cannot be to supplement declining wages through ever more government subsidy and borrowing.   The nation must begin a steady and firm move toward a sound money policy that creates confidence and stability in our struggling economy.”
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' comments today on the Obamacare implementation and government funding debate:  “The Obamacare exchanges officially go live tomorrow and will cause millions of Americans to lose their existing health plans. Millions more—as the labor unions have warned—are seeing their 40-hour work week turned into part-time jobs, or even eliminated… But Leader Reid and President Obama are building a fortress around the law—even as more and more train wrecks are discovered in the 2,700-page bill no one had time to read… They’re not willing to change one jot or tittle of their law to protect a single worker. This is the definition of ideological inflexibility… I call on Senator Reid to negotiate with House Republicans and to work to spare our citizens from this train wreck. The President has exempted big businesses and others in the political class. It’s time to protect the middle class. It’s time for the White House to acknowledge the bill is unworkable and that action is needed to protect the American people… My priority will remain the same: to defend Alabama workers and their families.”
Sen. Sessions delivered the second speech in a series today detailing with hard stats the economic struggles facing working Americans. Here is an excerpt from the remarks:   “What we are seeing is immensely troubling: as Washington grows larger, wealthier, and more powerful, Americans workers are being impoverished, sidelined, and marginalized. The government class is being enriched at the expense of the middle class. From deficit spending to federal regulation to the immigration bill—Washington is pursuing policies that benefits lobbyists and the well-connected but that reduces wages and job opportunities for everyday workers in the private sector.”
Sen. Sessions just cast a ‘nay’ vote against cloture on the CR. Senators Sessions and Shelby can be seen in this C-SPAN image from the Senate floor talking with Senators Lee and Cruz during the vote.
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' remarks on the Senate floor earlier today:   “We have to know that the Affordable Care Act is deeply unsound financially. The President’s promise, repeatedly made, that it would not add one dime to the debt… Is that true? No sir, it’s not true.  This is a hugely unsound new entitlement program that will endanger the financial future of America at a time when we need to quit digging ourselves deeper in debt and begin to work our way out of debt.”
Sen. Sessions delivered a speech today listing some of the gravest problems with the President's health law. Earlier this week, he joined with Sen. Cruz during his historic speech on the Senate floor.
When [Host Steve Bannon] asked earlier in the interview about how members of the Senate’s Gang of Eight, President Barack Obama, and others who support amnesty do not talk about [how] the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said illegal immigration would drop under the Gang of Eight bill plan at best by 50 percent of current levels, Sessions described a campaign-style marketing machine pro-amnesty forces have cobbled together to drive for the unpopular policy…  "And when you talk about do the American people know they’re going to more than double the number of low-skilled workers that would come into the country at a time of persistently high unemployment, and a low percentage of people in the workplace? No, they don’t want to talk about that."
Sen. Sessions: “Write it down: this is just the beginning… We are not going to allow this country to socialize medicine… That’s what the goal is, and we’re not going to allow it. We’re going to fight it, fight it, fight it.”
Sessions: “[Senator Cruz’s] leadership has served a valuable purpose tonight. And I am pleased to be able to support [his] effort.”  Cruz: “I thank the Senator from Alabama. I thank him for his perseverance, his leadership, and his courage. I will say there have been more than a few legislative fights in even the few months I’ve served in this body in which Jeff Sessions and I have been fighting side-by-side. And I appreciate his friendship and wisdom, and it matters in this body.”
Ranking Member Sessions is on the Senate floor with Sen. Cruz right now. Watch live here:
Sen. Sessions will appear live on the Rick and Bubba Show at 10:35am ET / 9:35am CT to discuss Obamacare.
Sessions: "Senator Reid, the Majority Leader, flatly stated a month ago he believed in a single-payer system… and of course the President [said he] did [too]…  I intend to support you [Senator Cruz], and I’m not going to vote to move a bill where we are sure we’re going to be blocked from having any meaningful discussion of one of the most historic, damaging bills in maybe the last 100 years that would basically move us to single-payer, government-run socialized medicine."
Sessions: "This is really offensive to me, and I think it should be to all Americans. This is the kind of leadership we have from corporate America?”
Sen. Sessions will be speaking on the Senate floor momentarily to discuss the effort to defund Obamacare. To listen live, please click here:
Sen. Sessions and Sen. Lee pen joint piece for Breitbart News:  “How can House leaders ask a single member of Congress to vote for step-by-step bills if they’re leaving the back door wide open to a comprehensive bill?  It’s not step-by-step if the bills are merged with the Senate monstrosity at a later date—either through a formal conference or a closed-door negotiation… If House members allow any of their proposals to be combined into an omnibus immigration bill, they would, in effect, allow White House strategists and their special interest allies to determine the final outcome of immigration much the way they shaped the creation of the original Gang of Eight bill. They would be handing the reins over to the very people who have made it their mission to suspend the constitutional rule of law in matters of immigration enforcement.”
Sen. Sessions: "At a time when we should be focused on helping American workers, making America more competitive in the global economy, and solving our debt crisis, this Administration is focused on restricting American energy sources and driving up prices."
Sessions: “This is a fight the American people are demanding.”
In his floor speech today, Sen. Sessions discussed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's pumping:  “Many are concerned that the Federal Reserve is furthering the national wealth gap. Their 'quantitative easing' has boosted wealth in the investor class but has not benefitted the working class. This is not the way our policies should work. People who know what to do with low interest money seem to be coming out ahead, but the people who don’t have money, don’t have jobs, working part time instead of full time are slipping.”
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' floor speech on the state of the U.S. economy:   “It’s time for us to defend working Americans and their undeniably legitimate concerns… We’ve got to ask ourselves if we should bring into our country, through our immigration policy, more people than we have jobs for? Won’t that pull down wages and make it harder for people to get work? Shouldn’t we defend our workers more effectively against unfair trade from around the world? There should be bipartisan support for both of those policies…  The road we are on today leads to the continued erosion of civil society, the continued expansion of the welfare state, and the permanent entrenchment of a political class that profits from the growth of government. It is time that we recognized both the disastrous conditions facing working Americans and the moral obligation we have to replace government dependency with the freedom and dignity that comes from work and independence.”
“I have directed my staff on the Budget Committee to conduct a detailed analysis of the economic conditions facing working Americans: their wages, their employment, their household finances. I will give a series of talks over the coming weeks looking at their financial condition and the state of our nation economically…  It’s not just the unemployment rate, which remains too high at 7.3 percent… It’s the number of people we all know who are working well below their potential because nothing is available that uses their job skills… You have to go back to 1995 to find median household income that is lower than it is today…Our civil society today has certain weaknesses that we need to discuss…  It is time that we recognized both the disastrous conditions facing working Americans and the moral obligation we have to replace government dependency with the freedom and dignity that comes from work and independence.”
Ranking Member Sessions will be speaking on the Senate floor TODAY during the 12:00 o’clock hour to deliver the first in a series of speeches analyzing the state of the American economy. Today’s speech will present evidence on the deteriorating conditions facing working American households, including wages, employment, and social circumstances. You can watch live here:
President Barack Obama told business leaders today that he wants close cooperation between his government and their companies.  “We want to be a consistent partner with you on a whole range of issues,” he told the D.C.-based Business Roundtable, an association for the CEOs of major U.S. companies, which, combined have more than $7.3 trillion in annual revenues and employ nearly 16 million people.  The proposed partnership would have CEOs lobby Congress for passage of Obama’s goals, including passage of a Senate bill that triples the rate of immigration to add 33 million immigrants over the next decade, and passage of a budget that doesn’t cut Obamacare’s federally-run health-care system, Obama suggested.  “It is going to be important for all of you, I think, over the next several weeks to understand what’s at stake and to make sure that you are using your influence in whatever way you can,” said Obama.
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions' statement on the President's pick for his top economic advisor:  “What we desperately need is economic leadership that is willing to look the American people in the eye and tell them the truth about the disastrous conditions facing working Americans. Someone who can lay out a plan for the future that includes more than tax and spend and debt. Someone who can end the stagnation and decline and help the economy to grow…[but] the President has appointed a loyalist whose main contribution to the economic debate has been to mislead the public about the effects of the President’s budget plans…  Adjusted for inflation, median household income is lower than at any point since 1998. Wages are lower today than in 1999. A quarter of all youth are unemployed. Welfare and poverty support programs now comprise more than one-fifth of federal spending. The federal debt stands at $16.7 trillion...  We are in an economic period marked by alarming long-term trends: a shrinking workforce, expanding welfare rolls, flat or falling wages. What does the White House offer? Increased regulation and taxation of the private sector, endless ‘stimulus’ in the form of borrowed money, massive government intrusions like Obamacare, expanded guest worker programs to replace dislodged workers, and a fierce defense of a failing welfare bureaucracy.  Sadly, with Mr. Zients’ selection, the White House has decided the problem is not the policy. He wants to continue further down the same road, without a leader who can offer fresh insight to reverse these unacceptable trends…”
Sen. Sessions just released this statement urging the President to reconsider his nomination of Jeff Zients to be Director of the National Economic Council.
Do you remember this Obama Administration budget director who repeatedly refused to say whether spending would go up or down under the President's 2013 budget? Well, President Obama just nominated him to be his top economic adviser on the National Economic Council.
Sen. Sessions on September 2013 being named National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month:   “Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men and 2.5 million families in the United States live with this disease. While we have made great advances in treatment and research, prostate cancer affects 1 in 6 men in the United States during his lifetime and it is critical we continue to raise awareness to promote early detection for a disease that impacts so many. We need to encourage every man to become fully educated about his risk for prostate cancer and to evaluate options with his physician. Knowledge, education, and awareness are the keys to fighting this disease.”
Sen. Sessions released the following statement after cosponsoring Sen. Cruz's Defund Obamacare Act of 2013:  “I have supported and will continue to support efforts to repeal, delay, defund, and block this unaffordable and invasive law. Obamacare will not only make health care less affordable but will reduce the quality of health care and patient choice, increase unemployment, and surge the nation’s debt. The Defund Obamacare Act is the latest effort to protect American families from this unwise government takeover.”
Excerpt from Sen. Sessions op-ed today in The Hill:   "We have heard repeatedly from House leadership that the Senate bill is 'dead on arrival' and that, instead, the House will pursue a comprehensive proposal in smaller chunks. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), certain business groups, and anti-enforcement advocates have all expressed optimism about the House’s approach. Presumably, this is because they believe the House’s individual bills will be melded into the Gang of Eight’s proposal (either in conference or closed-door negotiations) to form a new comprehensive bill.   The House must disavow the Senate bill completely and offer it no hope of reprieve, reprisal, or resurrection. Instead, the House must refocus the immigration debate on the rights, needs, and concerns of U.S. citizens. By promoting the constitutional rule of law, rising wages, and economic assimilation, the House can ensure a better tomorrow for all U.S. citizens — immigrant and native-born alike."

Here is an excerpt of his remarks in the video:  “The idea that we are going to tax, borrow, spend by the government and that this is going to revive our economy, make our lives better, and help the average American have a more healthy and prosperous life is being proven false... At a time of slow job growth, we don’t need to be doubling the number of guest workers brought into America… The last thing your federal government should do at this point in time, when Americans are hurting and we have fewer working since 1978, is to have policies that make it harder for people to get a job.”

Excerpt from Sen. Sessions op-ed today on crafting responsible immigration policy:  "Cheering Senate passage [of the Gang of Eight bill], the White House released a new report declaring that the Senate bill’s large proposed expansion of our already very generous immigration programs -- including a further surge in 'low-skill visa programs' -- is exactly what our country needs.  Here is one gem from the White house paper: 'The broader leisure and hospitality industry -- one of the fastest-growing sectors of the United States economy -- also stands to benefit significantly from commonsense immigration reform… like agriculture, a portion of their current workforce is undocumented. Leaders of these industries have been longtime proponents of legislation that would legalize workers in the U.S. and facilitate the lawful employment of future foreign-born workers. The head of the American Hotel and Lodging Association this year applauded the Senate on behalf of the lodging industry for its bipartisan commitment to immigration reform.'  Are we really to believe that the leisure and hospitality industry cannot get by unless (as the Senate bill does) we both pardon them for the large-scale hiring of illegal workers and then provide them with a substantially expanded flow of low-skill workers from other countries?"

“Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama’s top deputies, said Tuesday that immigration reform would be as important to the country’s future as Obamacare… 'It will be a landmark piece of legislation,’ she told a videotaped meeting of progressive allies in a building alongside the White House…[Jarrett] described the immigration bill as a gain for a progressive version of civil rights. She ignored its economic impact on individual Americans’ wages and employment prospects… The Senate bill, which was approved in July, could double immigration rates to add 46 million foreigners by 2033, and give the federal government more control over companies’ labor supply…opponents of the pending immigration bills say they will shrink most Americans’ wages and wealth, and hit low-skilled Americans hardest.”
Sessions issued the following statement on the passing of Bill Bates:  “With the passing of Bill Bates, the state of Alabama has lost a treasure. Bill was a patriot who loved and honored the values upon which America was founded. His was an American success story, helping to turn a small business into an icon on I-65. He relished traveling the state, meeting new folks, and always enjoyed a hearty political debate with old and new friends. He was a positive and key figure in the nurturing of a fledgling Republican Party in Alabama to its position of strength today.   Up until the day he left us, Bill embodied grassroots politics. This enthusiasm was evident in his desire to attend each presidential inauguration, braving the D.C. cold for hours to hear and see America's newest leader. Always committed to his family, his community, and his country, he was a man of character. He will be dearly missed by those of us who were lucky enough to know him. He was a true friend to me and I will greatly miss his positive spirit and support.”
“‘Frankly, I don’t think the House should pass any bill until the administration shows its willingness to confront and fix this problem,’ said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a vocal opponent of the current legislation pending in Congress. ‘This is a direct threat to the orderly administration of our immigration law,’ Sessions added, predicting that even the perception of easy entry into the U.S. by claiming asylum could create havoc on the border as thousands more try the same tactic.”

In response to a recent news article that revealed startling abuses in the Lifeline "Obamaphone" program (see here: http://bit.ly/17PUNvk), Sen. Sessions sent a letter to the FCC today asking a series of oversight questions about the program and the apparent failure to check applicants' eligibility.
Sessions: Asylum Request ‘Abuses’ Should Put Brakes On Immigration Bill:   "The House cannot allow such actions to continue. They must use every power they have to end this absurdity. No immigration bill should advance until these abuses are ended."

Sessions: “The federal government now spends over $750 billion per year on means tested welfare and assistance programs. And, of that, we spend over $100 for benefits for every $1 spent for job training… Our goal must be to help struggling Americans move from dependency to independence, to help them find steady jobs with rising pay. Our policy cannot be to simply relegate more and more of our citizens to dependence on the government while importing a steady stream of foreign workers to fill available jobs… [our priority must be] restoring the rule of law, defending working Americans, and helping those struggling—immigrant and native-born alike—to find a good job that can support a family.”
Sen. Sessions just issued the following comment about this morning's jobs report:  "This morning’s jobs number of 162,000 demonstrates that we still aren’t adding enough jobs to get Americans working again.  Underlying today’s jobs report is a set of far more troubling statistics that have not gotten sufficient scrutiny. A large and growing number of Americans are simply no longer part of the labor force. Only 55 percent of U.S. adults are working—millions have either permanently give up looking, moved back in with parents or relatives, retired early, or become dependent on government aid. Too little is being done to help get these Americans back into the productive economy. Meanwhile, working Americans have seen their wages continue to fall and median household income has dropped 8 percent since 2000.  These are deep and systemic problems arising from a variety of sources: the decline of American manufacturing, an increasingly burdensome and punitive tax and regulatory code that makes it harder for U.S. workers to compete, health care policies that grow government but shrink private sector hiring, welfare policies that undermine upward mobility, and a government stimulus policy that helps businesses and traders but not workers. Yet, despite all these problems, Washington’s focus right now is on an immigration bill that would reduce wages even further and increase unemployment—as CBO confirms—by drastically expanding low-skill immigration.  We need to refocus our economic policy in Washington to deal with the economic realities of our time. Instead, Washington continues to centralize power—helping the well-connected while punishing the average citizen."
Sen. Sessions will be speaking on the Senate floor this evening at approximately 7:20 ET / 6:20 CT to discuss efforts by the White House and the business lobby to push a comprehensive immigration bill during the month of August.

Sessions: "Perhaps we can finally have this debate out in the open—and dispense once and for all with the idea that the CEOs bankrolling the immigration push are concerned with anything other than reducing the cost of labor. It’s not about 'reform'—it’s about profit…Immigration reform has become synonymous with corporate welfare. It’s time we became more concerned with the welfare of millions of struggling workers and taxpayers."
Sessions visits with Boy Scout Troop 400 of Huntsville.
"Instead of trying to save the Schumer bill with a ‘comprehensive’ accord, Republicans need to focus on helping out-of-work Americans find good-paying jobs that can support a family. The comprehensive effort underway in Congress not only provides amnesty before security measures are achieved but calls for an unprecedented increase in low-skill immigration. Our immigration system is of course broken, but the efforts we are seeing now would make things much worse—particularly for struggling workers of all backgrounds." - JS
Sen. Sessions released the following statement tonight after President Obama suggested the actions of his administration had played a role in Airbus' decision to build a manufacturing plant in Mobile:  “I was surprised to hear that President Obama has claimed credit for the decision of Airbus to come to Mobile. Indeed, his actions in tilting to Chicago-based Boeing in the intense tanker competition with Airbus could have been a fatal blow to the Airbus desire to construct a manufacturing facility in Alabama. In fact, his campaign, in an unseemly way, bragged about Boeing’s win.   The truth is, Airbus came to Alabama despite the actions of the Administration. The hard work of state and local officials and the strong workforce in Alabama were the key to their decision.”
Sessions' statement on Gunter Annex being named one of the nation's first core data centers:  “I’m extremely excited about the selection of the Montgomery Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) site as one of the eight Core Data Centers for the DoD. This has been a tremendous effort over the past few years that has seen great collaboration between the local community, industry, the leadership at Maxwell-Gunter, and Alabama’s state and federal representation. DISA made a fantastic choice in naming Montgomery, which will mean future jobs and investment in the community.”
Sessions is speaking this afternoon at the 20th Annual Eagle Forum Collegians Leadership Summit at the Heritage Foundation. He will deliver remarks on how the GOP needs to fight the Senate immigration bill and broaden its appeal to working Americans.
Excerpt from Sessions' post in National Review's "The Corner":  "Politico reported this week that 'Big Business, Senate Republicans and Democrats backing immigration reform have a target in their crosshairs: House Republicans.'  Why is the business lobby so eager to pass the Senate bill? Is it because they believe its large influx of low-skill workers will increase wages or reduce them? The question answers itself.  Polls show the GOP lost the last election because we failed to connect with lower-income Americans… So the GOP needs to do some soul-searching."
Sessions: “We come here today with a message for Congress: we need an immigration policy that serves the American worker and taxpayer. We need an immigration policy that creates higher wages—not lower wages. We need an immigration policy that helps promotes upward mobility and financial independence. We need an immigration policy that helps our struggling citizens find good-paying jobs that can support their families and lift up their communities.”

"There's no promise, there is no likelihood in my view of serious enforcement. So I think the magnet, the incentives for people to continue coming when they get legalization, remains. And... there's a huge increase in immigration in that bill, two to three times the number of immigrants over the next decade as over the last decade. And that is bad for working class and middle class wages and economic opportunity in this country. And I think that's something Republicans need to get serious about."
Sessions spoke today at the DC March for Jobs rally against the Senate immigration bill. He emphasized the bill's negative impact on workers.
Excerpt from Sessions' speech to Young Republicans in Mobile:  “Speaking in an aircraft hanger adjacent to the decommissioned USS Alabama, Sessions drew a clear and damning line between the increased importation of low-skilled workers that the Senate bill would effect, and stagnating wages and high unemployment for current Americans…the senator rejected outright the claim that Republicans must acquiesce to the Senate’s desired reform package in order to stay electorally viable. On the contrary, Sessions argued, Republicans should fight for the working class that the Democrats have abandoned. That is the way back to power.”
Sessions released the following statement today after DHS Secretary, Janet Napolitano, announced her resignation:  “Secretary Napolitano’s tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was defined by a consistent disrespect for the rule of law.    The resignation of Secretary Napolitano should refocus the attention of Congress on its first task: to ensure that the executive branch faithfully carries out the laws of the land. The most significant obstacle to immigration reform remains President Obama’s selective enforcement of the law. Any selection—interim or permanent—to replace Secretary Napolitano must disavow these aggressive non-enforcement directives or there is very little hope for successful immigration reform.  Whoever replaces Secretary Napolitano must restore the rule of law, as well as the morale of ICE officers which has plummeted under her tenure.”  See the attached link for more background:
Sen. Sessions, along with Senate colleagues, visited with troops and military officials overseas during the Fourth of July holiday.
Senators: "[The health care] law is unworkable and harmful to the economy and to American families, and your actions to delay the employer mandate are an acknowledgement of this fact.  While your recent action provides temporary relief for some, we believe that all Americans deserve permanent relief from this onerous law, so that we can adopt common-sense reforms that will actually lower costs and that Americans support."
Excerpt from Sessions' new op-ed on immigration: "The Senate immigration bill is Obamacare’s 1,200-page legislative cousin. It is a disaster on every level. Republicans should make no effort to salvage it or to offer even the slightest hope of revival. Instead, we should draw sharp and bold contrasts that earn the loyalty of our faithful supporters and the newfound respect of the millions of working Americans who have turned away."
Representatives for all three immigration enforcement agencies—ICE, Border Patrol, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services—have now come out in opposition to the Senate immigration bill. Although the House of Representatives has indicated it has no plans to take up the Senate bill, the immigration officers' opposition indicates just how much remains to be done to repair our broken and lawless immigration system.
“I wanted to thank everyone for their kind words and support during the Senate immigration debate. I am endlessly impressed and humbled by the insights and wisdom of the people we are so privileged to serve. Too often—as the immigration bill reminds us—elected representatives forget that they work for the people. Rest assured, the debate over immigration reform has only begun. We can succeed in establishing a truly just system of immigration—one that strengthens the rule of law, advances the national interest, and reflects the good and decent values of the American public.” – J.S.
Excerpt from Sessions' statement after the immigration bill passed the Senate:   "This legislation demonstrates that the governing body in Washington has become severed from the people it is supposed to represent. It is a broken promise 1,200 pages long."
Sessions released the following statement after Senate passage of the immigration bill:  “Sponsors of this legislation—despite the array of financial, establishment and special interest support—failed to hit their target of 70 votes. The more people learned about the bill the more uneasy they became. Failure to reach 70 votes is significant, and ensures the House has plenty of space to chart an opposite course and reject this fatally flawed proposal.   So while the bill passed the Senate, this is just the beginning.   The legislation adopted today guarantees three things: immediate amnesty before security, permanent future illegal immigration, and a record surge in legal immigration that will reduce wages and increase unemployment.   There will be no border fence, no border surge, nothing but the same tired illusory promises of future enforcement that will never occur. Americans have begged and pleaded time and again for Congress to end the lawlessness. But this amnesty-first bill is a surrender to lawlessness. As ICE and USCIS officers have warned, it will decimate immigration enforcement and erode the constitutional rule of law upon which our national greatness depends. And it remains unfair to the legal immigrants who put enormous time and expense into following the rules our nation has established.   This legislation demonstrates that the governing body in Washington has become severed from the people it is supposed to represent. It is a broken promise 1,200 pages long.   The Senate’s loyalty must be to the American people—immigrant and native-born alike—who work hard, pay their taxes, fight our wars, and obey our laws. 21 million Americans cannot find full-time work. Medium household income is almost ten percent lower today than it was in 1999. But this proposal would double the number of guest workers for businesses and provide permanent legal status to more than 30 million mostly-lower skill legal immigrants in the next ten years. This huge increase in the legal immigration flow will reduce wages and raise unemployment, and displace those who have suffered the most economically. As wise observers have said, we are a nation with an economy—not an economy with a nation.   We can create a lawful immigration system that makes us proud. But for that to happen, this bill must never become law. We must return to the drawing board and produce legislation that serves the just and legitimate interests of the nation, its people, and all who wish to call America home.”

Excerpt from Sessions' speech on the Senate floor this morning: "You must know friends that, when the Gang of Eight said there was a delicate balance — a fragile agreement — they weren’t talking primarily about the agreement among themselves — that was secondary. They were referring to the special-interest forces that were in the room writing the bill. Those interests, those forces, had signed in blood. The Gang then signed in blood to fight off any serious ideas that would violate the secret pact."

Excerpt from Sessions statement on Senate immigration plan: “What we know for absolute certain is that this bill guarantees three things: instantaneous amnesty, permanent lawlessness, and a massive expansion in legal immigration that will reduce wages for working Americans.”
Sessions: “The sponsors of the Corker-Hoeven substitute fell short of the votes they expected tonight to advance what they had erroneously billed to other Senators as a strong border security amendment. Failure to capture the votes they anticipated for this motion demonstrates the building unease this 1,200-page legislative monstrosity has created. I expect that unease will increase as Senators learn more about what’s really inside this proposal.  The Gang of Eight and their allies revealed their true tactics tonight. They shut down debate and blocked amendments to a 1,200-page immigration bill that no one has read. It was anything but the open and fair process that they had promised.  What we know for absolute certain is that this bill guarantees three things: instantaneous amnesty, permanent lawlessness, and a massive expansion in legal immigration that will reduce wages for working Americans. This legislation is a crushing blow to the working people of this country, a surrender to illegality, and a capitulation to special interests over the interests of the citizens we pledged to represent.”

ICE Officers: "If forced to vote today, on behalf their constituents, Senators must vote no on this 1,200 page substitute bill... The 1,200 page substitute bill before the Senate will provide instant legalization and a path to citizenship to gang members and other dangerous criminal aliens, and handcuff ICE officers from enforcing immigration laws in the future."
USCIS Officers: "[Corker-Hoeven amendment] will exacerbate USCIS concerns about threats to national security and public safety… This bill should be opposed… Hopefully, lawmakers will read the bill before casting their votes."
Sessions: “The vote that we’ll be having later this afternoon is not on the Corker-Hoeven amendment as I think most Senators may have thought… It was filed as a complete substitute to the whole bill. So this is a vote this afternoon to give Majority Leader Reid procedural control of the debate. It’s his motion to shut off debate on a 1,200-page substitute [that] no one has read… This is exactly what happened with Obamacare. The majority rushed through a complex bill so there would be no time to digest what was in it.”

CRITICAL ALERT: Vote Today On Reid Procedural Motion To Silence Debate On Entire 1,200-Page Substitute Bill No One Has Read  Vote Is Not On Corker-Hoeven As Standalone, But Entire Merged Proposal  1,200-page substitute provides immediate amnesty without enforcement; legalization for convicted criminals; vast unchecked discretion for Secretary Napolitano; almost instant access to state and local benefit programs; ICE and USCIS officers warn new substitute bill is even worse for public safety and national security than original bill  Sessions: “The vote today is not a vote on just the Corker-Hoeven amendment. The vote today at 5:30 pm is a vote on Majority Leader Reid’s procedural motion to shut down debate on a 1,200-page substitute bill no one has read. The Corker-Hoeven amendment no longer exists as a standalone proposal. The amendment and the bill have been merged into a single 1,200-page substitute proposal. They are now one and the same. And the Majority Leader’s motion will stifle amendments and accelerate the vote on final passage before anyone has vetted the modified legislation.  A vote for cloture is therefore a vote for silencing debate on 1,200 pages of provisions including:  • Immediate amnesty without enforcement • Weakened interior enforcement • Legalization for gang members and convicted criminals • Unprecedented amnesty for future visa overstays • There is no border surge—agents aren’t required until 2021 which means it will never happen—and DHS retains the explicit waiver authority to build no fence and install no technology at all. • A dramatic increase in low-skill legal immigration that CBO says will reduce wages for U.S. workers  A vote for cloture is also a vote in favor of a process that has included a series of earmarked provisions as ‘sweeteners’ to obtain votes, including: $1.5 billion in federal stimulus spending for the vote of just one single senator and changes to visa rules to benefit industry in a single state.  Senator Rubio said he wouldn’t support a process that was rushed and that was not transparent. I hope that he, and all members who believe in open process, will vote against Majority Leader Reid’s motion to silence debate on a bill no one has read. And I would further issue a challenge to the sponsors of this bill: if your proposal is so good, then why not commit to extensive, open debate on it? Why do we have to pass this out of here before Members go home to face their constituents over July 4th? Whose interests do we serve?”
Sessions op-ed in USA Today: “The U.S. Senate is on the verge of delivering a crushing economic blow to you and your family.  The wages of working Americans have been falling since 1999. But the immigration bill hurtling to a vote in the Senate would add 30 million mostly lower-skill legal immigrants over the next decade — tripling the current legal immigration rate. It would also double the number of guest workers…  One in seven recent college graduates is unemployed. One in three Americans without a high school diploma is out of work. One in two African-American teenagers looking for a job can't find one. Yet the Senate plan would provide immediate work authorization for those here illegally, while dramatically expanding the avenues for businesses to hire workers from abroad…  Every special interest was consulted in the crafting of this immigration bill. Left out of the equation is you, your family and your country. Where does your senator stand?”

Sessions: "This bill grants amnesty first and a mere promise of enforcement in the future, even with the Corker-Hoeven amendment, all of which has been put in now on a 1,200 page [bill] we’ll vote on Monday afternoon that no one has read… These promises of 20,000 agents won’t take place and are not required until 2021… It [even] has a specific provision that says the Sec. Napolitano does not have to build a fence if she chooses not to… And CBO concludes that the legal immigration will be dramatically increased… Why would any Member of Congress want to vote for a bill, at a time of high unemployment [and] falling wages, to bring in a huge surge of new labor that can only hurt the poorest among us the most?”
Sessions: "Already, in a short time, we have identified grave and deep flaws in the modified bill – both in terms of failure to live up to new promises made as well as some shocking changes that actually further weaken the underlying bill. The special interests who wrote these provisions know exactly what they do and designed them not to work – but I fear some of the Senators who sponsored this amendment have no idea they’re even there."

Sessions: “[According to CBO]: ‘The average wage would be lower than under current law over the first dozen years.’ … That should be the end of the bill right there…  So I don’t see how we owe loyalty to Mr. Zuckerberg, [the] Facebook billionaire who’s running ads telling us what we’re supposed to do… I suspect if Mr. Zuckerberg were to post job openings tonight on his Facebook, put out his salaries and what he wants to pay, he’d find there might be plenty of Americans who want to take these jobs. I suspect so. So I’d ask him to do so: put on your website what kind of qualifications, what kind of salaries you’ll pay, and let’s see if we don’t have more applications than you’ve suggested exist out there.”
Sessions: “Much of the focus to date on the security flaws in the Gang of Eight plan have centered around the fact that it provides immediate amnesty without border security. Less discussed, however, is how the Gang of Eight plan decimates future immigration enforcement inside our borders… The Gang of Eight plan not only would effectively create an immediate amnesty for those here illegally today but a permanent de facto amnesty for future illegal aliens who arrive tomorrow… The Gang of Eight worked with the special interests to craft provisions to further handcuff law enforcement from doing their jobs.”
Sessions will be speaking on the Senate floor momentarily on the CBO's finding that the immigration bill will reduce wages. You can watch live here:
Sessions: “This bill guarantees three things: amnesty, increased welfare costs and lower wages for the U.S. workforce… It would be the biggest setback for poor and middle-class Americans of any legislation Congress has considered in decades.”
Sessions remarks on the CBO score for the Gang of Eight immigration bill:   “The bill’s drafters relied on the same scoring gimmicks used by the Obamacare drafters to conceal its true cost from taxpayers and to manipulate the CBO score. There is a reason why eligibility for the most expensive federal benefits was largely delayed outside the 10-year scoring window: to mislead the public. As Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, I asked CBO to provide a long-term estimate. Sadly, CBO did not provide the long-term estimate as requested. As a result, the score effectively conceals some of the biggest long-term costs to taxpayers contained in this legislation, including providing illegal immigrants with Medicaid, food stamps, and cash welfare. Some members of Congress are already pushing efforts to expedite this eligibility.  Welfare and entitlement costs will increase across the lifespan of the illegal immigrants legalized under this legislation. CBO did not provide enough information to assess the assumptions it made about the educational background of illegal immigrants and thus their methodology may be substantially flawed. An accurate analysis would acknowledge that half of that population does not have high school degrees, and is therefore more likely to receive far more in government support than they will pay in the form of taxes. For every dollar a low-income illegal immigrant might pay in either taxes or payroll contributions, he or she could easily receive two dollars back from the government in the form of public assistance for their household. It defies logic and common sense for anyone to suggest there is not an enormous cost in choosing to provide welfare to those who are currently not eligible for these benefits.  CBO’s score also necessarily fails to capture one of the most significant fiscal impacts this bill would have: the immediate fiscal burden on cities and states. When illegal immigrants are first legalized, they will become almost instantly eligible for local and state programs at a great cost to taxpayers. These costs will be increased substantially by the unlimited chain migration that is called for under the bill.  Finally, on wages: it is natural that a large increase in the number of legal immigrants added to the United States—an increase of at least 46 million by 2033 according to CBO, including a doubling of the number of guest workers—will increase the GDP. But, as Dr. Borjas has illustrated and as CBO confirms, this increased GDP will be at the expense of poor and working-class Americans. The benefit will go to the business owners while the wages of U.S. workers—which should be growing—will instead decline. That is indisputable, and while CBO did not sort out the effects among U.S. residents, the impact will be harshest for today’s low-income Americans. Meanwhile, the 21 million Americans who can’t find full-time work will have an ever harder time getting a job and supporting their families. More of them will therefore qualify for means-tested benefits, adding to deficits.  This bill guarantees three things: amnesty, increased welfare costs, and lower wages for the U.S. workforce. It would be the biggest setback for poor and middle-class Americans of any legislation Congress has considered in decades.”

Sessions: “[This legislation] creates an unprecedented flow of new workers into America—the likes of which we have never seen before—and it will have a direct result of depressing job opportunities and wages of American citizens [and] people who are legally here as immigrants… Don’t we have a responsibility to consider how it will impact people who are unemployed today?”

This morning, Sen. Sessions explained why "it’s time for the Gang of Eight to start being straight with the American public.”:  “When the Gang of Eight first announced their immigration bill they declared it was the toughest enforcement plan in history. They declared enforcement would come before legalization. And they declared that anyone who suggested otherwise didn’t know what they were talking about.  Now the bill has been reviewed and there can be no dispute: it weakens current law, undermines future enforcement and puts amnesty—not enforcement—first. So new promises of amendment ‘fixes’ to save the bill should be viewed with great skepticism: every time, on every issue, the promises have not matched with reality. They promised back taxes—but the requirement isn’t there; they promised tight restrictions on welfare benefits—but state and local benefits, as well as tax credits, will be available immediately and federal welfare access is granted to millions of illegal immigrants starting in five years; they promised to protect workers—but this bill would devastate workers by tripling the number of legal immigrants over the next decade and doubling the number of guest workers.  No small cosmetic fix can save this bill, with so many provisions clearly authored by special interests whose chief desires are lower wages and amnesty—rather than a lawful, rational system of immigration.  As the ICE officers’ association warned: ‘instead of cracking down on the Administration’s abuse of power, S. 744 places unprecedented new restrictions on interior enforcement—making the current situation much worse and much more hazardous. It is as if S. 744 were explicitly written to handcuff law enforcement officials—binding their hands while giving virtually unchecked authority to executive branch officials to prevent future removals, including removals of criminal aliens.’ And as the USCIS adjudications officers warned: ‘the legislation was written with special interests—producing a bill that makes the current system worse, not better. S. 744 will damage public safety and national security and should be opposed by lawmakers.’  It’s time for the Gang of Eight to start being straight with the American public.”
Sessions just issued the following comment:   “I am not encouraged by Senator Rubio’s recent comment that ‘a lot of Republicans want to be supportive of something, but need to be able to go back home and tell people that they have taken serious steps to make sure this never happens again.’  This is the whole problem: it’s not about just passing ‘something’ and telling the American people we’ve fixed the problem. It’s about actually fixing the problem.  Yet the Gang of Eight has been inaccurately telling us for months that this is the toughest enforcement plan in history. Now they are telling us they have an amendment to make the untrue thing they said before true. If they want to repair their credibility they need to do more than ‘tell’ people things, they need to actually accomplish those things. For too long they have focused on spin and promotion—not substance.”
Sessions: "While the authors of this bill will inevitably tout the fact that adding 30 million immigrants to the nation will increase the GDP, they won’t say it will be at the expense of struggling U.S. workers—immigrant and native born—who are trying to support their families and climb into the middle class."

Excerpt from the National Review on inflated deportation statistics:   “[Jessica Vaughn, Center for Immigrations Studies] noted that, contrary to the administration’s claims, the number of illegal-immigrant removals has dropped 40 percent since June 2011, when ICE director John Morton issued the first of several directives outlining significant changes to the agency’s enforcement policies. ‘There has been a significant decline in enforcement activity as measured by the number of removals.'"  “Removals generated by ICE’s Enforcement and Removals division, which is responsible for interior immigration enforcement, have decreased nearly 50 percent since June 2011.”  “Deportations specifically of illegal immigrants convicted of a crime — individuals the administration says it has prioritized for removal — are similarly down, almost 40 percent since June 2011, Vaughan found.”  “‘DHS and ICE are knowingly manipulating arrest and deportation data with the specific intent of misleading the American public with regard to the enforcement of illegal immigration in our country,’ [Chris Crane, National ICE Council President] told reporters Thursday at a Capitol Hill press conference. ‘At an alarming rate, ICE arrest and deportation numbers have plummeted since 2008, clear evidence that interior enforcement has in large part been shut down over the last four years.’”

Sessions writing in the Los Angeles Times:  “On every major front, this legislation fails to deliver on its core promises. It delivers only for the special-interest groups who helped write it. Should it pass, it would represent the ultimate triumph of the Washington elite over the everyday citizen to whom Congress properly owes its loyalty.”
“If you have amnesty, if you have illegality of millions of people, what are we going to do to ensure it doesn’t happen in the future?... The standards of current law with regard to what ought to be done—requirements in current federal law—are being weakened, some of them eviscerated by this bill.”
“We know that there was one group not included in these talks, and that is the group that is given the duty to enforce the laws involved in immigration, the National ICE union. The Customs and Enforcement organization pleaded with the Gang of Eight, they urged the Gang of Eight, they wrote letters to the Gang of Eight, I sent information to the Gang of Eight, asking them to consult with the officers who have the duty to enforce this law, but to no avail. [The National ICE union] was shut out of every meeting and were never really consulted.”

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, cited reporting from The Hill in arguing that the Mexican embassy and other foreign entities have had access to lawmakers, while the law enforcement community has been shut out. Sessions voted against the bill that was reported out of committee last month.  “We got this bill off to the wrong track in the beginning,” Sessions said on the Senate floor. “Powerful groups met, excluding the interests of the American people.”
Here is an excerpt from Sessions' ongoing remarks this morning:  “We did have a mark-up in the Judiciary Committee. We were allowed to offer amendments, and we did have some debate there, but it was odd in that, repeatedly, members, not even in the Gang of Eight, would say ‘I like this amendment, but I can’t vote for it because I understand it upsets the deal.’ So we need to ask ourselves, who made the deal? Whose deal is this? And how is it that the deal is such that members of the United States Senate, who agree with an amendment, say they must vote against the amendment because it upsets some deal.  Who was in this room? Who was in the deal making process?  I contend, and I think it is quite plain, it was because [the Gang of Eight’s bill] was not written by independent members of the Senate, in a more open process, but was written by special interests… Powerful groups met excluding the interests of the American people, excluding the law enforcement community, throughout the bill you can see the influence that these [special interests] groups had on the drafting of [the bill.]… The point to make is, and what I think our colleagues need to understand, and the American people need to understand, in reality, the special interests – La Raza, the unions, the corporate world, the big agriculture businesses, the food processers – they are the ones that made the agreement in this process, and the Senators just sort of ratified it. And they can’t agree to a change because they promised these special interest groups.”

Sessions Lays Out Moral Case For Better Approach On Immigration:   “[Sen. Sessions] argued that in granting work authorization for [over 30] million…the [Gang of Eight’s] bill will benefit corporate titans by flooding the labor market and holding down stagnant salaries in an already weak economy. In short, it will lead to disaster for those Americans now clinging to the bottom rung of the economic ladder…  The [Gang of Eight’s] proposal ‘does not hold up to scrutiny,’ [Sessions] insisted. ‘We're going to tell the truth about the bill. We're going to expose it… somebody needs to ask questions about this bill, they don't get to write a bill in secret, and we all roll over and have it passed without examination… we should serve and listen to the concerns of the working Americans who are making $20,000 to $45,000 a year… That includes Hispanics, African-Americans, and Caucasians… One of the reasons their wages haven't gone up is because there's too much labor. And so, if we end the illegality with a good, principled immigration bill, (if) we allow a generous but responsible flow of immigrants in the future, and if we improve the lives of working Americans, then that's the way you win elections.’”
Sessions: "This will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of American workers—both immigrant and native born... This bill is bad for workers, bad for taxpayers and—as immigration officers have pleaded for us to hear—a threat to public safety and the rule of law."
The Gang of Eight immigration bill passed out of committee this evening. Here are some excerpts of Sessions' statement in opposition:  “During the course of this markup, we have conclusively established that this legislation fails to live up to every major promise of its sponsors. Ironically, the only promise the sponsors of this legislation have kept is their promise to block any attempts to improve the proposal. As a result, we are left with legislation that is fundamentally unchanged and fatally flawed. It will not become law.  First, on security: The core promise from this bill’s sponsors was that it would be enforcement first. But, we now know it is legalization first. And the future enforcement provisions actually represent a weakening of laws previously enacted by Congress.  For instance…  … The ICE Council, and sheriffs across the nation, have written to Congress warning that this bill would be “a significant barrier to the creation of a safe and lawful system of immigration.” The letter also notes: “Congress can and must take decisive steps to limit the discretion of political appointees and empower ICE and CBP to perform their respective missions and enforce the laws enacted by Congress. Rather than limiting the power of those political appointees within DHS, S. 744 provides them with nearly unlimited discretion, which will serve only to further cripple the law enforcement missions of these agencies.”  A second immigration enforcement union—United States Citizenship and Immigration Services—has also come out against the bill, warning: “like the ICE Council, the USCIS Council was not consulted in the crafting of the Gang of Eight’s legislation. Instead, the legislation was written with special interests—producing a bill that makes the current system worse, not better. S. 744 will damage public safety and national security and should be opposed by lawmakers.”  What about the cost to taxpayers? Along with Ranking Member Grassley and Senator Roberts, I sent a detailed request for long-term cost estimates to the Gang of Eight.  No such estimates have been provided.  According to the nation’s leading welfare expert—Robert Rector—it will add $6.4 trillion to our long-term debt.  What about the promise that illegal aliens would not be eligible for federal benefits? In just the last 24 hours, this committee has rejected three amendments – including two I offered—to prevent illegal aliens from getting means-tested financial assistance.   Finally, and most importantly, I would like to talk about the impact on American workers. Sponsors of this legislation have said it will not significantly increase total immigration levels. But we have conclusively demonstrated that this bill would legalize 30 million immigrants over ten years and provide legal status to many millions more temporary workers. This will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of American workers—both immigrant and native born…  This bill is bad for workers, bad for taxpayers and—as immigration officers have pleaded to us—a threat to public safety and the rule of law. It serves the special interests at the expense of the national interest.  Therefore, I must oppose.”

Sen. Sessions remarked on the amendments he is filing to the Gang of Eight immigration bill ahead of the Judiciary Committee mark-up on Thursday:  “Unfortunately, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have had less time to review this nearly 1,000-page bill than the special interests who wrote it behind closed doors.   The Gang of Eight plan fails to live up to every major promise of its sponsors. There’s no border fence. There is no practical back taxes requirement. And illegal aliens will become eligible for every federal benefit, costing taxpayer trillions. It undermines enforcement and weakens our lawful immigration system.  Some of the amendments I have filed try to repair the damage this bill does to enforcement, public safety, and national security. I have also offered amendments to close the many welfare loopholes in the proposal.  One particularly crucial amendment I have filed defends American workers. This bill would authorize a dramatic surge in permanent low-skill and chain migration—and would bring in millions more temporary foreign workers—at a time when 90 million Americans are outside the labor force and nearly 50 million are on food stamps. The result would be lower wages and more unemployment.  The amendment I have offered would cap the number of foreign workers granted admission to the country, and immigrants granted legal status, at approximately 30 million over a decade, with a shift to a more merit-based system over the low-skill surge in the proposed legislation. 30 million, while considerably lower than what the Gang of Eight has proposed, is still an extremely high number and must be reduced further. But this amendment is a starting point in scaling back the extraordinary and unacceptable future flow in this bill. Reasonable immigration levels are also necessary to promote assimilation.  Already, one of the bill’s chief sponsors has admitted it will have trouble in the Senate and can’t pass the House. If even the modest amendment I have offered fails, it is exceedingly difficult to see a way forward for this bill. There is simply no public support for a tripling of the immigration flow into this country as this legislation calls for.”
Sessions released the following statement today on the Heritage Foundation's report which found the Gang of Eight's immigration plan would impose $6.3 trillion in long-term net costs:  “The study released today by Heritage about the costs of the Gang of Eight’s proposed amnesty should be heeded by all lawmakers. The study puts to rest the contention that the bill will benefit American taxpayers, reduce our deficits, or strengthen our already endangered Social Security and Medicare programs. At a time when our nation’s major entitlements are already nearing bankruptcy, we cannot afford to add another $6.3 trillion in long-term net costs to already over-burdened state, local, and federal governments. Robert Rector, the chief author of the study, is the nation’s leading expert on welfare and one of the pioneers of welfare reform.  The granting of citizenship is a privilege, not a right, and our nation simply cannot afford to provide every benefit of citizenship—including unlimited access to our nation’s welfare and entitlement programs—to millions of illegal immigrants and visa overstays who will draw more from these programs than they pay in.  In addition to these enormous long-term costs, the Heritage report shows this proposal will also take a great toll on American workers. It proposes to drastically increase the future flow of legal immigration over the next decade—providing 30 million immigrants with legal status in addition to 27 million temporary work permits that will be issued—which will reduce Americans’ wages and job prospects.  This bill may be good for the special interests who helped write it. But it’s bad for workers, bad for taxpayers, and fails to serve the national interest.”
Click here to see a link to the Heritage Foundation report that shows the cost of amnesty to taxpayers will be $6.3 trillion:
More than 30 million immigrants will be granted legal status in 10 years; an additional 25 million will be granted temporary work visas, bringing the total to 57 million.

Sessions released the following statement today on the Gang of Eight’s immigration reform proposal:  “The bill produced by the Gang of Eight is nearly 1,000 pages long and will impact every aspect of our society and every single American worker and taxpayer. It will take months—not days or weeks as the Majority proposes—to review this legislation.  Already, we know that the bill’s sponsors have abandoned their core promise to the American people that enforcement would come first. This bill is legalization first, not enforcement first. The day the bill passes there will be effective amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, with only the same promises we have heard before of enforcement to occur at some later date. That amnesty will then become official in a matter of months—once DHS merely submits a plan for border security in the future. That’s not a trigger—that’s the honor system. DHS develops the metrics and DHS decides when those metrics are met. Why should we trust DHS to follow through—after amnesty is granted—when this administration has aggressively defied those laws already in place?  In recent years interior enforcement has been significantly undermined. And yet our interior enforcement needs are almost totally neglected in the Gang’s proposal. Alarmingly, the bill leaves intact the single greatest obstacle to immigration reform: the Administration’s abuse of prosecutorial discretion to prevent the enforcement of federal law. It will also provide safe harbor to those who have committed a variety of offenses—ranging from identity theft, to multiple immigration violations, and even those with criminal records.  This bill opens up citizenship to recent arrivals and, remarkably, millions who overstayed their visas. If adopted, this bill would send the following message to the world: if you get a U.S. visa and it expires, never leave—just stay put and evade detection. It even opens up citizenship to those who have been deported from the country.  Economic concerns abound as well. Once illegal immigrants are granted green cards, they will become eligible for generous welfare and entitlement programs. Because of how these benefits are structured, low-wage illegal immigrants who are legalized will ultimately receive trillions more in benefits than they contribute to these programs. Obamacare alone, over the long term, will see its unfunded liability grow by $2 trillion. The unfunded obligation for Medicare and Social Security, together, would likely increase by $2.5 trillion.  Most importantly, this proposal would economically devastate low-income American citizens and current legal immigrants. It will pull down their wages and reduce their job prospects. Including those legalized, this bill would result in at least 30 million new foreign workers over a 10-year period—more than the entire population of the state of Texas. This at a time when 90 million Americans are outside the labor force and a record number of our citizens are on welfare.  As with 2007, this entire process has been marred from the beginning by allowing special interests to place their priorities above the national interest. Instead of spending months courting the support of big business and labor bosses in Washington, the Gang’s first meeting should have been with the immigration enforcement officers who know the flaws in our system better than anyone. And before proposing a dramatic increase in the number of low-skill foreign workers, they should have met with experts about how this would hurt struggling Americans.  Has Congress forgotten who it represents? Congress’ duty is to the American people.  I believe it is going to be clearly established that this plan will be detrimental to working Americans—and will not pass. What Congress needs to understand is that our obligation is to law-abiding Americans who have seen their wages erode over the last decade. We can’t further weaken their financial position in order to provide more benefits to those here unlawfully.  I understand the hard work that went into this bill. But as we explore its many flaws and loopholes in the coming days, I am confident the American public will firmly reject it—and will demand reform that puts the national interest first.”
Sessions issued the following comment on the terror attack in Boston:  “Our nation mourns for the dead and prays for the victims and their families. We must do everything in our power to support the city of Boston in her hour of need and to track down and punish every last person responsible for this attack upon our country.”
Sessions issued the following statement today:  “When the Gang of Eight was first formed a publicly stated principle was the enforcement would come first—before legalization. Today, on the Sunday shows, Gang of Eight members admitted that they abandoned this principle and that, in fact, legalization—or amnesty—would come first. This proposal offers immediate legalization with unfulfilled promises of enforcement in the future. This is contrary to the commitment they made to the American people and raises the same core problem as the 2007 proposal that was rejected by the American people. This should not surprise given that Gang of Eight has refused to meet with ICE officers while consulting with the special interests. The proposal will not stand up to scrutiny.  Another area of great concern in this proposal is the impact it will have on low-income Americans and those individuals and communities suffering from chronic underemployment. The guest worker program in this proposal represents only a fraction of the increase in legal foreign workers that will be rapidly introduced. Including those illegal immigrants that are legalized, this bill, over ten years, will result in at least 30 million new foreign workers—more than the entire population of Texas. While this may mean lower wages for the business lobby, and more political power for AFL-CIO leadership, it will be bad for American workers—union and non-union. And it will expose taxpayers to enormous long-term costs, including trillions in unfunded liabilities for Medicare and Social Security from which low-wage foreign workers will draw more benefits than they pay in. These programs need strengthening, not further weakening.”

Sessions discussed President Obama’s budget plan this morning on FOX’s America’s Newsroom:
Sen. Sessions' statement on the President's budget submission to Congress:  “Every expert and specialist has told us that our current spending trajectory is dangerously unsustainable. We know this. Yet the long-delayed White House plan—once all the gimmicks are removed—surges spending even more. After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, the President proposes a net spending increase of $1,025 billion above projected growth, including a $154 billion spending increase next year and a $61 billion increase this year. This is not merely reckless; it is unthinkable. Once again, the President has submitted one of the most irresponsible spending plans in the history of our nation.  Under this plan, spending will rise 56 percent from today’s levels—including a 70 percent increase welfare and poverty spending—and the debt will rise by $8.2 trillion. Despite promises of $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, the budget contains only a tiny fraction of that amount, just $119 billion, meaning that our debt will surge to $25.4 trillion in 2023—permanently above the danger zone of 90 percent of GDP that is crushing growth and jobs today. Taking into account new spending this year, actual deficit reduction is just $59 billion.  This plan also betrays an arrogance in the White House: apparently they believe the government is perfect and requires no reform. They raise taxes by $1.1 trillion to spend even more money—taking from American workers to finance the continued expansion of the state.  This proposal goes to extraordinary lengths to shield the federal bureaucracy from any reform, even as millions of Americans are trapped in failed government programs. It grows the government at the expense of the economy. It enriches the bureaucracy at the expense of the people. And it threatens to permanently depress the American economy under a never-ending avalanche of debt.”
In their letter to the Republican members of the Gang of Eight, Sen. Sessions and his colleagues pointed out: "As we discovered through several oversight requests from the Agriculture, Budget, and Judiciary Committees, existing federal immigration law designed to protect taxpayers is not enforced by this administration."
Sen. Sessions released a statement today after Chairman Leahy confirmed there would be only one hearing on the massive comprehensive immigration legislation that is supposed to be unveiled soon:  “The process that Chairman Leahy has described – a single hearing on a potentially 1,500 page bill – is unacceptable. It is an explicit rejection of the process demanded by Judiciary Committee Republicans and endorsed by Senator Rubio. To acquiesce to such a process would be to accept the Majority’s plan to rush through this massive legislation before the American people know what’s in it. Now that the special interests have what they want, the deal has been made: force it through and set the public interest aside. As with 2007, the drive to enact amnesty supersedes all else – including the open government principles of our democratic Republic. The American people are being shut out, the law enforcement community is being shut out, and the people’s representatives are being shut out.   We need a committee hearing on every component of reform, including the extraordinary potential costs to taxpayers, the impact on wages and job prospects for the unemployed, and the Administration’s continued refusal to enforce the laws previously enacted by Congress.   Failure to commit to this kind of open process is tantamount to an admission that the bill is not workable and will not stand up to public scrutiny.”

Senator Sessions’ office released a document today called “Ten Questions For The Gang Of 8.” Encourage everyone to take a look and share. Here is the introduction:  Due to the enormous complexity of immigration reform and the profound consequences for American workers, taxpayers, and society at large, many have advocated for a step-by-step approach rather than a comprehensive one. The last attempt at comprehensive legislation was riddled with flaws and loopholes that made it unworkable—serving the special interests but not the national interest. Dozens of crucial questions remain for the Gang of Eight that must be resolved before any proposal can properly be called comprehensive. The American people have a right to know the answer to each of them—and to express their views during a thorough period of public hearing and review. The public must know exactly what’s in any far-reaching proposal before anyone votes on it. With that in mind, here are 10 questions for the Gang of Eight:

Sessions issued the following statement today after the jobs report was released:  “Today’s jobs report reveals that 90 million Americans are now outside the labor force. We need to be getting Americans back to work, helping people move off of food stamps and welfare, and find good jobs with steady incomes. But the comprehensive immigration bill being drafted right now would provide nearly immediate work authorization to millions of illegal immigrants while substantially increasing the future flow of workers. Our first priority must be to help American citizens, and current legal immigrants, find good employment. What we cannot have, and what is not sustainable, is an economic system where a large and growing share of our population is permanently unemployed while jobs are filled by a constant supply of foreign workers.”

Sessions visited Coffee County yesterday and spoke about key issues impacting the state:
Sessions issued the following statement today after Chairman Leahy’s latest declaration of his intent to rush through an immigration bill before the American people know what is in it:  “I was alarmed by Chairman Leahy’s letter to Senator Rubio in which he rejects the GOP call for thorough and full consideration of any comprehensive immigration bill. Chairman Leahy’s letters to both Senator Rubio and to Committee Republicans reveal a determination to rush a bill through before the public can get involved in the process. Chairman Leahy, Leader Reid, and President Obama once again want Congress to pass a far-reaching bill before the American people know what’s in it. Now that the special interests have what they want, the deal has been made: force it through and set the public interest aside.  Chairman Leahy’s mention of the possibility of maybe holding a single hearing is not a pledge of openness, but a confirmation of our suspicions. A sound committee process will take months—not the two-week timeframe Chairman Leahy has outlined—and will require extensive hearings to understand every major component of reform, including: • How the immediate legalization of millions of illegal workers will impact unemployed Americans • How a further increase in the number of guest workers will impact unemployed Americans • How the wages of legal workers and legal immigrants will be affected by the future flow of low-skill immigrants and chain migration • The long-term cost to taxpayers, especially as illegal immigrants become eligible for most welfare and public benefits once granted green cards and citizenship • Tracking visa overstays • Metrics for establishing border security • Resuming and strengthening cooperation with local law enforcement • Resolving the concerns of ICE officers, including the abuse of prosecutorial discretion and so-called deferred action • Worksite enforcement • Ensuring that the currently unenforced public charge law is enforced • Ensuring proper input and evaluation from the law enforcement community  These are only some of the many complex, serious, and emotional issues that must be addressed in detailed public hearings. Failure to commit to this kind of open process is tantamount to an admission that the bill is not workable and will not stand up to public scrutiny.”

Today, Sen. Sessions issued a statement which read in part: "Every American worker, union and non-union, is right to be concerned about a large guest worker program combined with a large amnesty of illegal workers. There is no doubt that such a plan will reduce Americans’ wages and job prospects. Ultimately, Congress must recognize that has to be focused on meeting the needs of unemployed and underemployed American workers."

Sen. Sessions will appear on the Mike Huckabee radio show today at approximately 11:30 a.m. CT to discuss his efforts to prevent comprehensive immigration reform from being rushed through the Senate before the public has a chance to examine the bill or understand its far-reaching implications.
Sessions issued the following comments on the efforts of Leader Reid and Chairman Leahy to attempt to rush through the Gang of 8 immigration bill in April before people know what’s in it:   “Last week, Ranking Member Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Cornyn, Senator Lee, Senator Cruz, and myself sent a letter to Chairman Leahy warning against a rush to pass an amnesty bill before the American people know what’s in it. In his reply to our letter, Chairman Leahy effectively informed Committee members that he has every intention of moving on a rushed timetable that would make it impossible for lawmakers or the public to properly assess a bill of this magnitude.   Specifically, it seems the Chairman is arguing we can put a bill on the floor two weeks after the Gang of Eight potentially produces legislation in early April. The Chairman’s suggestion that we don’t need hearings on this new proposal because we have held immigration hearings in the past misses the entire point: the massive proposal being cobbled together by a group of Senators in secret must be independently judged and reviewed by the Judiciary Committee in the full light of day. That will take months—not two weeks—and will require hearings on every aspect of this issue: protecting American workers and wages, protecting our public benefit programs and ensuring enforcement of the public charge law, evaluating the size, scope, and impact of any guest worker program, tracking visa overstays, etc.   No member of Congress who believes in democratic procedure can acquiesce to the ramming through of a thousand-page bill that will dramatically and directly impact the taxes, wages, and security of our constituents.”

On behalf of all the law enforcement officers represented by the National ICE Council, I would like to thank Ranking Member Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator Sessions, Senator Cornyn, Senator Lee and Senator Cruz… We have a very real concern that the immigration bill being crafted behind closed doors by a group of eight lawmakers will be rushed to passage without proper public consideration and proper input from the law enforcement community. Our politically appointed leaders, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and ICE Director John Morton, do not speak for us when it comes to enforcing the law. Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton have repeatedly undermined the ability of our officers to enforce and protect the public safety. We believe the first priority of Congress ought to be ensuring that the immigration laws it has already passed are enforced.”

Excerpt from Sessions' remarks on the Senate floor:   “Any Senator who votes for this budget is saying to the American people: Washington is not the problem, you are the problem. They're saying we've managed your money well, we've done it all right, we did nothing wrong. The problem is YOU. YOU haven't sent us enough money. In fact, this budget says send us another $1.5 trillion in more taxes. Send more money. Now, they also say, but don't worry, you won't have to pay those taxes. We're just closing loopholes. But closing loopholes doesn't come close to getting this many taxpayer dollars. It just doesn’t.”
Senate is opening debate on the Murray Budget - the first Senate Budget proposal on the floor in four years' time. The House passed 'No Budget, No Pay' to compel the Senate to reveal their proposal. Senator Sessions is leading debate for the Minority on the floor right now.
Yesterday, Senator Sessions and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter warning against a rush to consider the ‘Gang of 8’ comprehensive immigration proposal that is being drafted. Today, Senator Sessions issued the following statement on the purpose of the letter:  “We have an obligation to adopt an immigration policy that serves the national interest, not the special interests—whether those special interests are open-borders advocacy groups, large corporations, or the political establishment. In order to serve the national interest, it is imperative that the Judiciary Committee fulfill its responsibility to review, scrutinize, and independently judge any immigration bill we consider. We have heard many promises before only to see the text of the bill fails to live up to those promises.  The process must be open and the public must be heard. A sound process in committee will take months, not weeks. And we’d be better off taking a step-by-step approach than trying to deal with these complex and emotional issues in one massive piece of legislation. And, contrary to the wisdom in Washington circles, our first and highest priority must be to establish lawfulness at the border and within the country. The consequences are simply too profound for American workers and taxpayers to rush through some thousand-page amnesty bill to passage only to find out what’s in it later. Such an approach would violate the fundamental principles of our democratic Republic.”
NA
Sessions and Judiciary Republicans sent a letter today to Judiciary Chairman Leahy demanding an open, public and transparent process for the consideration of any immigration bill produced by the so-called Gang of 8. The letter says in part:  “As you are aware, this bill potentially could be the most dramatic and consequential alteration of our immigration system in nearly 30 years, impacting nearly every aspect of our legal and economic structure, and increasing entitlement spending to historic levels… The last time Congress considered legislation of this magnitude that was written behind closed doors and passed with no process, it resulted in sweeping changes to our healthcare system, the negative consequences of which are only now coming to light…We do not make this request lightly and hope the Senators drafting such legislation will support our request.  If we are serious about protecting our national interest and the best interests of American workers, we must provide all members of the Senate, and, most importantly, the public, a full and fair opportunity to become adequately informed”

Sessions on Chairman Murray Budget Plan: Enriching The Bureaucracy At The Expense Of The People:  “Is it really possible that after four years, the majority has failed to identify any reforms? That all we have is just a tax-and-spend budget that makes no alteration to our dangerous debt course? Does the majority believe the government is perfect and requires no reform? … Is the Budget Committee of the United States Senate really prepared to say we cannot balance the federal budget? If that is so, it is a sad day in America…  I fear the majority’s plan will enrich the bureaucracy at the expense of the people… Every time attempts are made to reform government, they meet with the same response: the President and our Chairman and Senator Reid have attacked the reformers... Struggling citizens are being hurt every day by the Washington establishment that our colleagues seem determined to shield from accountability… We need to grow the economy, not the government.”

Click below to read the transcript of Sen. Sessions delivering the weekly GOP address. In his remarks, Sessions lays out a pro-worker agenda:   “We must act to create more jobs and better pay.  And we can do it without adding to the debt. Here’s how:  -Make welfare temporary and the welfare office an employment and job training office.  -Unlock America’s vast energy resources to create millions of good-paying jobs.  -Defend American workers from unfair foreign trade practices.  -Reform the tax code to make America globally competitive, creating more jobs here.  -Make government leaner, less wasteful so it produces greater results for the money you earned and sent here.  -Enforce an immigration policy that protects legal U.S. workers from unlawful competition.  -Eliminate every burdensome federal rule or regulation that isn’t needed and that destroys jobs.  -And, finally, we must balance the federal budget.  These steps will empower Americans—not the government.  They will promote family—not bureaucracy.  And they will help create a future in which the central bonds in our lives are not government rules but the love and loyalty we have for one another.”
Sessions commented today on reports of a potential impasse between business and labor leaders on immigration:  “A large increase in the supply of foreign labor will reduce the value of the individual American worker, threaten his job, and reduce his salary…we cannot introduce an endless supply of foreign labor—subsidized by government food, housing, and health care—that does not replace American jobs and pull down wages. The prospects for American workers cannot be forgotten in this process.”
Sen. Sessions today opposed the nomination of John Brennan to be CIA director, and he also voted against shutting off debate on the controversial nomination. To see the vote tally, please click here.
In case you missed it, the Daily Caller ran a story on Sessions’ oversight efforts about the enforcement of immigration law. Here is an excerpt from Sessions’ comments quoted in the piece:  “The data just provided by the State Department, like that recently provided by the Department of Homeland Security, dramatically confirms that federal public charge law is not being enforced,” [Sen. Sessions] said in a statement. “This helps explain a study showing that 36 percent of immigrant-headed households receive at least one major welfare program, adding billions to their cost…For those concerned about the size of government and the cost to taxpayers, this will be a major concern when addressing any immigration reform effort... When basic principles and laws like this are ignored, it is no wonder the American people doubt any promises of future enforcement.”
On Friday, the Associated Press ran a story uncovering how the number of illegal immigrants released from ICE custody was much larger than Administration officials had indicated. Sessions commented in part:  “This revelation, added to all the other lawless conduct of ICE leadership and the Administration, ought to make priority number one for Congress to bring the Administration into compliance with federal law.”
Earlier this evening, Sessions announced the implementation of the National Weather Service’s (NWS) upgraded Doppler radar at an event in Mobile:   “This upgraded Doppler radar technology will greatly benefit the people of the Gulf region. It can save lives. The ability to track and detect the effects of impending weather systems will inform the public and give our communities time to react with precise and timely information.”
Sessions issued the following statement on the need to reform the federal government:  "The President speaks of his deep concern for American workers and families, he fails to even submit to Congress his financial plan to help those workers and families… [In fact,] his golf weekend at the yacht club with Tiger Woods cost taxpayers over a million dollars—enough money to save 341 federal workers from furlough… [Federal] workers know firsthand how much waste and inefficiency exists in the government. Our Budget Committee office will look for a way to solicit federal employees to send suggestions for how to save money in their departments, agencies, and divisions. What is better? To furlough someone or to empower them to make their office more efficient?”
Sessions is hosting a press conference right now in Mobile regarding the Doppler radar upgrade which will warn residents of impending severe weather in the region.

Moulton Advertiser: Senators Pay Visits To Area
Sen. Sessions said at his Hackleburg stop that he was impressed with the way the area has seemed to bounce back following the tornado outbreak in April 2011, especially the new Wrangler distribution plant that is near completion. “It is so great to see the plant come back… I really felt, and I know a lot of us felt, that it was important that this plant come back here, psychologically as well as economically.”

During the debate on Jack Lew’s nomination to be Treasury Secretary, Sen. Sessions cited as one more reason to oppose Lew the fact that according to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward, the idea for sequestration (which Sessions voted against and has said unfairly targets defense while ignoring domestic reforms) actually originated with Mr. Lew: “In fact, he designed it… now he denies ever creating it in the first place.”
“Senator Sessions and Congressman Aderholt have been unbelievable to work with,” Crider said. “What really impressed me was this wasn’t all about helping out a Boeing, or some massive company. The effort they put in to help out our company, out here in Cullman County with 120 people, was great.”  Sessions visited HH Technologies as part of a regional industry tour Thursday to get a first hand look at the manufacturing operation the legislative work helped keep alive.  “It was a near run thing, and this company would’ve been hammered without relief,” Sessions said. “We finally got it through, and if that hadn’t happened, it may have been much longer before it was fixed ... It’s really pleasing for us.”
Sessions criticized the Administration for releasing hundreds of illegal aliens from federal custody over the weekend:   “The Administration’s forced release of those in ICE custody further reduces the chances of reaching a bipartisan immigration accord.  There is no logical or rational reason why the 5.3 percent cut to ICE’s operating budget would have to result in forcing law officers to immediately release already-apprehended illegal aliens and fugitives in federal detention. The last thing you would do to meet a budget cut of this size would be to voluntarily undertake actions that undermine the rule of law and endanger the public safety. These savings could be much more safely and rationally achieved, considering that they will be distributed among such areas as facilities maintenance, equipment maintenance, communications, travel, etc. The Administration also had months to plan for this eventuality and could have developed numerous alternatives to this reckless action.  It is clear the Administration is using the sequester as a convenient excuse to bow to political pressure from the amnesty groups, as it did with its unilateral decision to confer legal status on millions who are not lawfully present. With this new action, the Administration has further demonstrated that it has no commitment to enforcing the law and cannot be trusted to deliver on any future promises of enforcement.”
Sen. Sessions made the following comment yesterday during his visit to the rebuilt VF Jeanswear Wrangler Distribution Center in Hackleburg:   "They made a commitment to come here. They were assisted by all the local governments, and it was really important to me. I really felt and I know a lot of us felt that it was important that this plant come back here, psychologically and economically."

Sen. Sessions made the following comment today about President Obama's leaked plan and the secret immigration talks underway in Congress:   “The release of the President's immigration plan is more than a misstep or clever political maneuver. It is a dramatic disclosure of his real immigration ideology and goals. The plan grants amnesty on day one while making hollow promises of future enforcement that will never occur. The plan is a giveaway for the special interests and the open borders lobby.  This president will never dedicate himself to enforcing the law, and this plan offers only further proof of that.  It is plain what is happening. The special interests are again in the White House, demanding and getting their favors granted, while American workers and the public interest are again locked out.    Unfortunately, the leaked plan is little different in its substance from the Gang of 8 plan, which is also unlikely to withstand scrutiny. Crucially, both plans confer legal status and work authorization on day one in exchange for promises of future enforcement on which this administration will never deliver.  Perhaps this leak, and what it reveals, may mark the beginning of the collapse of this new scheme to force through a fatally flawed plan.”

Sen. Sessions sent a letter to Commerce Department Acting Secretary Rebecca Blank regarding the need to maintain anti-dumping duties and the negative impact that lack of enforcement on “fair value” pricing, for Vietnamese produced frozen fish fillets, has on the U.S. market.
Sen. Sessions comments on the State of the Union:   “Once again President Obama failed to look the American people in the eye and tell them the truth about our perilous financial condition or the egregious waste of taxpayer dollars that occurs every day. Excessive debt is pulling down growth, destroying jobs and incomes, and threatening every American worker. The President’s policies are creating dependency and poverty. No longer can we measure compassion by how much we spend on poverty but how many people we help to lift out of poverty. Our shared focus must be to help more Americans find good paying jobs and the ability to support themselves and their families.   Additionally, President Obama’s remarks on immigration are deeply troubling. The biggest obstacle we face to reform is this nation’s failure to establish lawfulness in the system. The President’s immigration plan meets the desire of businesses for low-wage foreign workers while doing nothing to protect struggling American workers. President Obama’s plan also ignores the dire warnings of federal law enforcement officers. Just today, the president of the ICE agents’ union wrote the White House and expressed his concern that ICE officers have been kept out of White House immigration meetings, detailing their many concerns over the evisceration of federal immigration law.  In that letter, he explained: ‘Until these concerns are resolved, I fear that any enforcement mechanisms in a future immigration bill will, like the laws already on the books, not be enforced.’”
Sessions sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Jeffrey Zients after Zients replied to a letter regarding Jack Lew’s role in the Administration’s four-year refusal to comply with a law requiring legislation to shore up Medicare’s finances:  “In order to properly consider Mr. Lew’s nomination, Congress will need documents pertaining to his role in the violation of this law, as well as a concrete legislative proposal that brings the Administration into legal compliance. Failure to do so could make it difficult for Mr. Lew’s nomination to move forward.”

President Obama met at the White House today with CEOs and progressive allies to discuss ways to advance the new immigration amnesty bill. In response, Sen. Sessions issued the following statement:  "Once again, our leaders are meeting in secret with narrow special interests to decide the fate of our immigration system while everyday working Americans are shut out. President Obama is meeting privately with the most powerful men in finance and business to discuss how to bring in more low-wage labor at a time when millions of Americans can’t earn enough to pay their bills. He’s meeting with progressive activists to discuss amnesty and chain migration. But what we need is an immigration policy that serves the national interest, not the special interests.  Who at the White House is speaking for the working people of this country? Who is speaking for the $15-an-hour legal worker who doesn’t want to lose his job to federally subsidized illegal labor? Who is speaking for the taxpayers who don’t want to burden their children and grandchildren with more debt to provide free federal benefits to the millions of people who are unlawfully present? Who is speaking for the victims of drug cartel violence that could be prevented if the borders were secure?  Somehow I doubt Goldman Sachs or La Raza is speaking for these Americans. We have seen this before: the 'masters of the universe' want low wages and cheap labor and don’t seem to care much about how it impacts workers or taxpayers. All lawmakers—Democrat, Republican, Independent—have a responsibility to our citizen and legal immigrant constituents to put their needs ahead of the special interests President Obama is meeting with today."

After yesterday's gun hearing, Sen. Sessions made the following comments:  "I was the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of Alabama, and we aggressively went after those who were found with guns in their possession during the commission of crimes. To this day, that district has the highest rate of federal gun prosecutions of anywhere in the country, and I am convinced that we sent a message to criminals. We saw a decline in the violent crime rate as a result.  Under the Obama Administration, prosecution of criminals for gun crimes has fallen significantly. So they are pushing for new laws to infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans while failing to do the one thing that will truly save lives: going after criminals for gun crimes."
Sessions introduces bill to create pro-worker energy policy:  “America is sitting on vast areas of untapped energy resources. These resources—many of which exist in our nation’s offshore areas—belong to the American people and yet they remained locked away. This bill will put these resources to use and create countless good-paying jobs and generate wealth at home instead of sending it overseas.  This is part of a broader effort to defend domestic manufacturing and industry, US workers, and families by keeping down the cost of energy and strengthening our competitiveness.”
Sen. Sessions, on the Senate floor just now, said this of the director of the U.S.'  top immigration law enforcement agency:  "At the center of this misconduct is John Morton, the director of ICE. The evidence that I am about to share with you leads me to the unfortunate conclusion that Mr. Morton can no longer effectively serve at his post, and perhaps more importantly there can be no comprehensive immigration reform as long as he's the person charged with enforcing it."
NA
Sen. Sessions: "A large-scale amnesty is likely to add trillions of dollars to the debt over time, accelerate Medicare’s and Social Security’s slide into insolvency, and put enormous strain on our public assistance programs.  We know already that the administration refuses to enforce existing law restricting immigrant welfare use, and in fact promotes expanded welfare use to immigrants—including food stamps, public housing, and Medicaid. I joined with four Ranking Members to obtain answers from the Department of Homeland Security about this evisceration of law, and the Administration has suspiciously defied three consecutive oversight requests."
Sen. Sessions also opened debate on the Senate floor today about this topic; video highlights will be posted here later this evening.

In September, Sen. Sessions and 41 of his Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief challenging the legality of President Obama's "recess" appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, because the appointments were not made when the Senate was in recess. Today the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the appointments were in fact unconstitutional, meaning the illegal appointments will be invalidated.
Yellowhammer Politics today discussed efforts to force the Senate to pass a budget: "This is a significant win for Sessions because he has been out front beating the drum on this issue for quite a while now. He has worked tirelessly to expose Senator Reid’s strategy of never producing a budget in order to shield his members from public scrutiny."  After refusing to lay out a financial plan for the country, Senate Democrats relented and said this week that they will produce their first budget in four years.
Sen. Sessions spoke on the Senate floor yesterday to detail Jack Lew's history of repeatedly misleading Congress and the American people about the fiscal impact of President Obama's budgets. Lew has been nominated to be Treasury Secretary, the top financial post in the country.
In a statement today, Sen. Sessions responded to the Senate majority's statement that they will acquiesce to his and other Republicans' demands that the chamber adopt a budget. Sessions emphasized that the plan should achieve balance within 10 years, not simply be described rhetorically as a "balanced approach":  "To compel Senate action I have introduced legislation, blocked recess, and encouraged the use of the debt ceiling as leverage. Now, with their pay threatened, and long-simmering public anger growing, Senate Democrats have suddenly seen the light... It certainly won't be easy to put this nation on a sound financial course, but it is essential. Needed fiscal changes will not only prevent an economic nightmare but they will reduce growing poverty, dependency, and joblessness and help more Americans live free and prosperous lives."
"It is unthinkable that Senator Reid and Chairman Murray would put the nation through turmoil because they refuse to do their moral and statutory duty to produce a budget…  Our current path—that of Greece—is one of chronically high debt, unemployment, poverty, and dependency. Adding endlessly to the debt is not compassionate; it is destructive. We must rescue the nation from this painful course and help those who need it most live better, freer, and more prosperous lives...  Our challenge is enormous, but a clear and responsible budget and smart legislation to end our nation’s reckless debt path can restore confidence and secure the future for today and for tomorrow."

Why don't we deal with the financial future of our that country that dwarfs really in the long run all these other issues that we are now wrestling with in Washington?"
Sen. Sessions addressed gun control proposals in an interview in Birmingham yesterday: "I just don't see how you can constitutionally or rationally expect semiautomatic weapons to go away and I'm not going to be supportive… There is a strong movement by a significant number of people, a minority, that really don't like guns… They grew up in the city, they never hunted. They're not familiar with guns. They see guns as very dangerous things. They don't want them around. If it was up to them we wouldn't have guns period."
