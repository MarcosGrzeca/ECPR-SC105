On the passing of former Governor James Edwards: My thoughts and prayers go out to Ann and Governor Edwards' entire family. Jim was an early mentor of mine as I entered public service, and I am forever thankful for his advice and encouragement.  From the dedication of Patriot's Point during his time as Governor to his efforts expanding MUSC while serving as President, Governor Edwards has left an important legacy in our state. No matter if he was serving as a Cabinet member for President Reagan or on a board for President George H.W. Bush, we always knew that Jim's heart was here at home with the people of South Carolina.
Excited to get some new socks! Hope everyone had a blessed Christmas with family and friends.
Merry Christmas from my family to yours!

Good to see everyone in Barnwell and talk with the Southern Carolina Alliance and Barnwell Chamber of Commerce!
Cool to see the 100 year old cash register they still use everyday at CB Forrest and Son in Saluda. One of my most favorite things about serving the people of South Carolina is the opportunity to travel our state and meet so many folks across all 46 counties.

Great to be back in South Carolina and talking with the students at McCormick High this morning!
Happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating. Chag Sameach!
I am certainly happy that Alan Gross has come home to his family. His imprisonment in Cuba for the past five years is yet another example of the dangers of the authoritarian regime in Havana.   However, I am also very concerned that the President has decided to reward Cuba for decades of human rights abuses, weapons trafficking, espionage and other abuses. Not only are three Cuban spies, one of which was convicted of murder, being returned to Havana, but with the Castro family still holding absolute power in Cuba we cannot trust that loosening travel restrictions and economic sanctions will do anything but line the pockets of the regime.   These actions will do nothing to increase the freedom and liberty the Cuban people deserve. Unfortunately, this is yet another example of this administration continuing to show the rest of the world, and dangerous leaders like those in Iran and North Korea, that the United States is willing to appease them.
Secret Santa in the office today!

Miss the Weekly Republican Address this morning? Watch here!  While many may be skeptical, and rightfully so given how broken Washington has become, Republicans are committed to returning government to the American people.  We know who our bosses are, and that you are more than capable of understanding what Washington does or does not accomplish.
We understand that it is not government that powers our nation, but rather the ingenuity, hard work and skills of the American people.  I gave this week's Republican Address, you can watch here: https://www.youtube.com/user/gopweeklyaddress
The walk back to my office from the Senate floor.
The NLRB approved a new rule today that is perhaps the most pro-union action taken by the current administration, which is quite a feat in itself. Ambush elections hurt the ability of employees to make a well-informed choice on joining a union, as it gives limited time to hear both sides of the debate. The rule also requires an unprecedented amount of an employee’s personal information to be given to union representatives, such as personal cell phones and email addresses.  Full statement here: http://www.scott.senate.gov/press-release/senator-tim-scott-statement-nlrb-ambush-elections-rule
So proud of and full of admiration for my brother, Command Sergeant Major Ben Scott Jr., for his 32 years of service. Amazing experience to be there for his retirement ceremony. Thank you Ben for your service, and also to all those who have served alongside you in defense of our nation.

The President's nominee for Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, has a wealth of experience that I hope will lead to solid decision making and long-term strategic thinking. I look forward to learning more about his ideas and abilities through the confirmation process.     However, it does not matter how qualified a nominee is for Secretary of Defense if the White House will not engage them in decision making. The new Secretary must be empowered to develop a cohesive long-term plan to combat threats such as ISIS. America cannot continue to lead from behind on issues of national security at home and abroad, and this administration needs to let military and defense experts, not politics, drive our policies.  http://www.scott.senate.gov/press-release/senator-tim-scott-statement-nomination-ashton-carter-secretary-defense

Every time President Obama and Secretary Kerry fail to meet deadlines in Iranian nuclear negotiations, we learn of more concessions given to Iran and are less certain that a deal will end Iran’s nuclear ambitions. This is absolutely unacceptable and will only make Americans less safe and endanger our friends and allies abroad.

Enjoyed serving meals at the Tri-County Family Ministries today.
The administration must now move quickly to nominate a qualified candidate for Secretary of Defense. The threats we currently face, be it ISIS, Iran or others, involve some of the most dangerous actors in the world.   The new Secretary must be willing and able to develop a cohesive long-term strategy to combat these threats and keep our nation safe.

As our nation has continued to discuss how to best address the significant issues with our immigration system, time and time again, President Obama has made it clear that he did not have the authority to act unilaterally.  Unfortunately, he has now decided that politics trump that fact.   This short-sighted view and these ill-advised actions will unfortunately have a host of unintended, negative consequences on an already strained immigration system. Attempting to justify his actions by harkening back to the 1986 immigration reform package is flat wrong – and ignores the fact that almost 30 years after 1986 our immigration system is more broken than ever.   While the President has decided once again that separation of powers only matters when it is beneficial to him, I sincerely hope he will reconsider these actions as we continue to look for solutions. The process must begin with securing our borders and fixing our legal immigration system, and I stand ready to work on those issues anytime.   America is both a compassionate nation and a nation of laws, and to keep that balance the White House must work with Congress, not, as the old phrase goes, take their ball and go home. Together, we can address the current issues with targeted, responsible efforts that secure the border, enforce existing U.S. laws, and create a workable, efficient system for future immigrants.
Enjoyed meeting these two young gentlemen who have benefitted from school choice and the DC Opportunity Scholarship at my keynote speech this morning on eliminating poverty!
“This notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true...We live in a democracy. You have to pass bills through the legislature.” - President Obama, 9/28/11
It is extremely disappointing that Senate Democrats and the President continue to block construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Their opposition to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs continues to amaze, and six years of stalling and delaying must come to an end.   http://www.scott.senate.gov/press-release/senator-tim-scott-statement-keystone-xl-pipeline

"Scott speaks with actions as well as words in saying veterans need to be honored for their commitment to the nation’s freedom, and the sacrifices of their families should be noted as well. “I have seen first hand the commitment required by the servicemen and women and their families, and it is truly incredible.”  We thank Scott for his emphasis on veterans and join the senator in saluting his two brothers and all others serving in the military, and saying a heartfelt “thank you” to all who have served before them."  http://thetandd.com/news/opinion/sen-tim-scott-due-praise-for-focus-on-veterans/article_76280932-6945-11e4-ac52-47376a0c1584.html

In case you haven’t seen my #OpportunityAgenda, today I’m sharing 10 important facts about it.  1.Significant parts of my #SKILLSAct were signed into law this year, working to make #job training more efficient and better tied to local needs.  2. The #CHOICEAct puts education back in the hands of parents, and  out of the hands of bureaucrats in Washington. #SchoolChoice  3. The #LEAPAct enjoys bipartisan support, and makes South Carolina’s successful apprenticeship program a national model.  4. The #SEAJobsAct calls for using sound science to determine our coastal resources, and could create up to 280,000 jobs.  5. The CHOICE Act helps kids with special needs have access to the education they deserve. I have had the honor of meeting Ms. Rachel Lewis of Greenville who benefitted from a similar program, and talked about her story here - http://youtu.be/tqoivHUmtIU?t=6m5s    6. My Opportunity Agenda was inspired in part by my grandfather. I talked about his life and what he means to me here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHRwjBXoHKM  7. The LEAP Act would help fill our nation's 4 million vacant jobs, and is paid for by cutting wasteful government printing.  8. The  SEA Jobs Act would both help veterans with job training and emphasize #STEM education at colleges, universities and #HBCUs.   9. The CHOICE Act expands educational options for 200,000 children living on domestic military installations.  10. I’ll announce multiple new initiatives in the coming months to help ensure all Americans have the chance to succeed! Learn more at scott.senate.gov/OpportunityAgenda!

My heart goes out to those infected with #Ebola and their families both in the United States and in West Africa. This is a terrible virus, and one the world must come together to stop.    As infections continue to spread here in the United States, the trust of the American people has been shaken by the administration’s response thus far. It is clear that a temporary travel ban for foreign nationals traveling from Ebola-stricken nations in West Africa should be put in place. The President has the authority to do so, and we have seen that airport screenings and self-reporting simply are not enough.  My full statement here: http://www.scott.senate.gov/press-release/senator-tim-scott-we-need-temporary-travel-ban-ebola-stricken-nations
In case you missed it: Yesterday the Nuclear Regulatory Commission released a report saying that Yucca Mountain would be a safe depository for nuclear waste for up to a million years.  It is clear the administration must stop delaying Yucca. South Carolina has agreed to temporarily hold some of this material with the understanding that a permanent solution would be found, and our state alone has contributed more than a billion dollars towards the Yucca Mountain project.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the Obama Administration will attempt to circumvent Congress, ignore the will of the American people and transfer prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to domestic locations, possibly including the Naval brig in Hanahan, South Carolina.  I have yet to see any plans or studies that show that transferring prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to South Carolina or any other domestic location will make America safer. We are talking about some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, including planners of September 11th and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole. They should stay right where they are – in cells at the prison on Guantanamo Bay, far away from our schools and families.  If the administration attempts to push this idea forward it will meet serious opposition, period.

My heart goes out to the family and friends of Steven Sotloff – no one should ever have to go through losing a loved one in such a barbaric manner. I will continue to keep the family of Mr. Sotloff and all the victims of ISIS in my prayers.    This tragedy reemphasizes that it is far past time for the President and this administration to determine a strategy for countering ISIS. Our nation’s current foreign policy remains nearly impossible to decipher, while the threat of ISIS’ brutal brand of violence continues to put millions of innocents in harm’s way.    The President must establish, clarify and communicate to both Congress and the American people the next steps forward in regard to ISIS, and must do so quickly. Those in danger do not have the luxury of waiting.
Hope you and your family are having a safe and happy Labor Day weekend!
Great seeing folks in Fairfield and Lancaster counties today!

As if the CBO report on #Obamacare wasn't bad enough - the report also shows if we don't change our spending habits, our public debt will be greater than our GDP by 2038.    We simply can’t let our kids and grandkids be saddled with such massive debt. We must make tough, smart, efficient choices moving forward.
Best of luck to all our South Carolina colleges and universities on #SigningDay, who do you think is going to have the best class?

Nearly half a century later, those ideas ring as strong as ever. Every child should have the chance for a quality education, and every American deserves the opportunity to succeed.  Dr. King’s work and legacy will forever be an integral piece of America’s history.

Swept floors, helped with food prep and talked with employees about issues affecting them and their families at Moe's in North Charleston this weekend.
After 50 years of a government-led "War on Poverty," poverty rates are increasing.  The questions for those of us in government are simple: Are we part of the solution or part of the problem? Are we an ally in this struggle to get ahead, or do we unwittingly make it more difficult? Are we trying the same tactics with the same results?  I will work with anyone else committed to building a better future to develop bold ideas that break away from our past failures.

I’m encouraged by the willingness we’ve seen from both sides to sit down and negotiate a budget agreement for the first time in years, but the details of this plan make me unable to support it.

PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checker released their "Lie of the Year" yesterday—President Obama's now infamous promise to Americans, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."    This lie has had consequences for all Americans, but for the approximately 4 million Americans who received insurance cancellation notices as a result of Obamacare, and the millions more who were duped into supporting an ultimately harmful policy, it hits especially hard.

While healthcare premium hikes are deservedly getting a lot of negative attention, soaring deductibles are making out-of-pocket costs so high that some consumers will see little benefit from their expensive insurance.    Obamacare is a failed policy—it's time to repeal and replace!

Nelson Mandela was a transformational figure, a man who truly changed the world. He walked a long road to freedom and embraced the fundamental human belief in equality.

Today I joined colleagues in asking the Supreme Court to respect the system of checks and balances established by our founding fathers, and to echo what we have already heard from three federal appeals courts—President Obama's flouting of the requirement for Senate advice and consent in the installation of his political allies to the NLRB was unconstitutional and must be reversed.

Sent a letter to the Administration this week asking the President to stop picking winners and losers by exempting unions from an Obamacare fee that applies equally to employers, charities, and faith-based organizations.

Shutdowns don't happen when Congress does its job. Our country deserves better than short-term, band-aid spending bills that only work well enough to get us to the next crisis.

Earlier today, Senator Reid told radio station KNPR that he hopes Republican opposition to President Obama is “based on substance and not the fact that he's African-American.”  I am sincerely disappointed by continued attempts to divide the American people by playing to the lowest common denominator. Instead of engaging in serious debate about the failed policies of this administration – from the ever-increasing burdens created by the national health care reform plan to the tax and spend approach to economic recovery, along with countless others – Democrats are once again trying to hide behind a smokescreen.   Our country deserves more from those in Washington. I hope Senator Reid will realize the offensive nature of his remarks and apologize to those who disagree with the President’s policies because of one thing – they are hurting hardworking American families.  http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/reid-i-hope-gop-opposition-to-obama-is

In regards to the President's speech today, for years, we have been hearing the same prescription from him – bigger government, higher taxes and more spending. Today, we simply heard the same ideas that continue to hold our country back.   We've seen countless examples over the past few years of government overreach hurting hardworking American families. Our entrepreneurs are willing to take risks and innovate so they can grow their businesses and hire new employees. So let's unleash the potential of small business owners, workers, and families by lowering taxes and reducing the size of government. Instead of punishing success, let's encourage it.    We need a simpler tax code, smart regulation and an education system that is second to none. I will continue to fight for an agenda that allows our country to live up to its potential as the greatest and most prosperous nation in the world.

Tonight’s announcement was a necessary first step. However, it remains clear that the President has not fully grasped the wide-ranging effects of the IRS scandal as it took nearly a week for him to act. This is not something that can be swept under the rug – we need permanent, systematic fixes to ensure that it does not happen again. The American people deserve better than what they have seen from the White House over the past week, and the President has a responsibility to cooperate with Congressional investigations as we work to get to the bottom of this.
Today I took action regarding the IRS' targeting of conservative groups for extra scrutiny. Targeting groups based on their political beliefs is an outrage, and the American people deserve answers. The President must provide complete transparency and cooperation as we get to the bottom of this administration's troubling pattern of intimidation and overreach.

Sent a letter to the White House warning that the Obama Administration is ‘jeopardizing’ the 60 year partnership between the Savannah River Site and South Carolina and Georgia.  http://www.scott.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=342759

Why is the NLRB asking for more funding when their caseload has dropped by 9 percent? My colleagues and I on the HELP Committee intend to find out.  http://www.help.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=3d432fd6-d376-4a20-843e-5ccc8a6e5f22&groups=Ranking
The IRS targeting conservative groups is unacceptable. At least three Congressional committees will investigate.

I oppose Congress exempting itself from Obamacare. Every American should be saved from this legislation together through full repeal.
Recent Democrats' quotes on Obamacare - "I just see a huge train wreck coming down" and it is "just beyond comprehension."   http://blog.heritage.org/2013/04/18/dem-senator-obamacare-a-train-wreck-coming/

As the gun debate comes to the floor of the U.S. Senate this week, I stand in full support of our Second Amendment rights and will oppose any legislation that infringes on those rights.
Instead of investing in government, let’s empower the individual. Less spending, lower taxes and fewer road blocks for our small business owners will unleash opportunities for all Americans.

Great day in the Upstate - excited to be in Greer for the groundbreaking of the South Carolina Inland Port. Look forward to the Inland Port becoming a model for the nation thanks to dedication and teamwork right here in South Carolina.
It was truly an honor to attend the dedication of the Rosa Parks statue in the U.S. Capitol today, an event I will not soon forget.   Her courage, strength and determination, which came to light on a bus in Montgomery nearly 60 years ago, continues to inspire us all.  Her efforts helped to break barriers across our nation, and allowed future generations to accomplish things our parents or grandparents may not have thought possible.  As her likeness takes its place in the Capitol, Ms. Parks will rightfully stand beside a multitude of American heroes.   http://www.aoc.gov/sites/default/files/styles/artwork-node/public/images/artwork/8512482669_7e57587fed_b.jpg?itok=ArxN3RYZ

Had a great time speaking at my alma mater Stall High School in North Charleston this morning. Good questions from the students!
I joined my colleagues in introducing a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. States have to balance their budgets and families have to keep their checkbooks in order – it only makes sense the federal government should as well.  http://www.scott.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=339677
Excited to serve as the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion. The lessons we’ve learned in South Carolina will be incredibly important as we work to unleash opportunity for all Americans, and I look forward to bringing some of those common sense, real world solutions to the committee.

I've joined my colleagues in working to rein in the NLRB and affirm the Constitution of the United States - we introduced legislation to stop paying unconstitutional appointees to the board and stop the unconstitutionally-filled board from making decisions that affect the lives and incomes of American families.  http://www.scott.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=339500
Continuing my efforts to protect YOUR tax dollars from wasteful spending, I have signed on as an original cosponsor of legislation permanently banning earmarks.  http://www.scott.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=339471
Today, a federal appeals court ruled that the President’s recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board last year were unconstitutional.  I am extremely pleased the court confirmed what we all knew last year – the President’s attempt to stack the deck at the NLRB was unconstitutional.  The NLRB was established to be an unbiased arbiter, but the President has turned it into a pro-union, anti-right-to-work organization. As a result, the Board’s activity has, at times, destroyed jobs and hurt hardworking American families, which we saw in South Carolina over the last two years, and cannot be allowed to continue down that path.
Yesterday I joined more than half of my colleagues in calling on the President to approve the Keystone Pipeline.   http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/us-usa-keystone-senators-idUSBRE90M1DC20130123
Would like to take a moment to observe National Sanctity of Life Day and to reaffirm our commitment to protecting all Americans, especially the most vulnerable among us.
