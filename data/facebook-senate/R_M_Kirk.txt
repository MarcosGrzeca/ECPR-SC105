Synthetic drugs are extremely dangerous & have become the drug of choice for teens in Illinois. As the major hub for these drugs that are harming children and sending profits to countries of state-sponsored terrorism such as Syria and Yemen, Customs and Border Protection at O'Hare are doing great work, but we need to cut off the flow of synthetic marijuana from the source.

This week Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson initiated monthly site inspections by Medical Center and VISN Directors in an attempt to restore integrity to the scandal-embroiled agency. The idea that corrupt VA Directors like Joan Ricard will be entrusted with reviewing the very fraudulent scheduling practices she oversaw at the Hines VA is insulting.

I am calling on acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson to declare a state of emergency that would allow veterans to seek immediate private care, rather than suffer extended wait times for care at a VA facility. It is truly disgusting that our nation's heroes, like Retired U.S. Army Private Michael Swan, were forced to wait for life-saving care while very senior executives collected bonuses for falsified wait times.

Today marks five years since fraudulent elections in #Iran and the rise of the Green Movement. After the violent crackdown, countless activists are still imprisoned. I discussed human rights issues with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Foreign Policy Initiative and USCIRF.
The bipartisan Veterans Affairs bill passed today takes the necessary and important first step towards ensuring improved care for Illinois' 700,000 veterans and ending a culture of corruption at the VA. I will continue to fight on behalf of our nation's servicemen and women to ensure they receive the quality care they so rightfully deserve.  Read more in my latest blog post: http://1.usa.gov/Uup6cb
We deserve to know what #VA found in audit – falsified wait times for #Illinois #veterans are unacceptable.
Illinois is home to more than 700,000 veterans, a number of whom already possess the life-saving skills and training required to be a firefighter, but who are forced to re-certify due to our state's outdated reciprocity rules. I urge Governor Quinn to pass commonsense reform in the reciprocity requirements which would ensure that the men and women who already possess these skills  are not subject to additional bureaucracy as they rejoin the workforce.

I am concerned about credible reports of secret wait lists at Hines VA, similar to the lists used in Phoenix. Sharon Helman, the current Phoenix VA Director responsible for overseeing the secret wait lists and neglect of veterans’ care, was also the Director at Hines from February 2010 to February 2012. The Inspector General should immediately broaden its investigation to include Hines VA and to deliver a swift and immediate report.  http://www.kirk.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1077

Congratulations to U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon and lead prosecutors Jennie Levin and Bethany Biesenthal on this suburban pimp's sex-trafficking conviction. I'll keep pushing bills that give prosecutors the tools they need to go after sex traffickers and pimps like him. http://trib.in/18CpG84
Manufacturing helps drive the #Illinois economy. Senator Joe Donnelly and I sent a letter urging a Senate committee to keep American #manufacturing competitive.
It's good to be home. Thank you for the well wishes and special thanks to the stellar team at NW Lake Forest Hospital for their great care.
The office of U.S. Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) today released the following statement:  "Saturday morning Senator Mark Kirk went to Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital with stomach pains. Doctors determined that, due to the fact that he had gall stones, his gall bladder needed to be removed. This morning Senator Kirk underwent a successful surgery to have his gall bladder removed and is resting comfortably. His doctor expects a quick recovery."
It's time that #Illinois embraces the infrastructure legacy of President Abraham Lincoln. By unlocking the potential of private industry, we can deliver projects like the Illiana Expressway more efficiently.
Nelson Mandela brought a new era of peace to South Africa. The world has lost a great champion of human rights.
My pen-pal Jackson continues his incredible stroke recovery. I'm thankful for his friendship. #NeverGiveUp

What are you thankful for? Use #TIMEthanks to let me know.

Based on the latest information available and after discussions with our allies, it is clear to me that the proposal on the table in Geneva would do nothing to prevent a future with Iranian nuclear weapons. The agreement would leave Iran's nuclear infrastructure in place while undermining the sanctions pressure we worked so hard to build. In short, it will increase the likelihood of war when we should be doing all we can to achieve a peaceful outcome. I will continue to press for intensified sanctions until I am assured we are not leaving our children a world with Iranian nuclear weapons. http://1.usa.gov/1d698IK

The Back of the Yard families whose lives were torn apart by last night's senseless shootings are in my prayers. The law-abiding citizens of these neighborhoods continue to suffer at the hands of dangerous drug gangs. Several weeks ago I spoke face-to-face with Englewood families. They told about the grief they experience — their everyday suffering at the hands of these drug fueled gangsters. Gangs are fueled by the money and power gained by engaging in criminal activity. Homicide, shootings, weapons offenses, human trafficking, drug trafficking and rape are just a few of the crimes associated with gangs. This tragedy is yet another reminder that we must work together to eradicate these gangs that are a cancer on our communities.  Full statement: http://www.kirk.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=867

The Illinois and Mississippi rivers are the lifeblood of the Midwest's economic engine. At a time when the Army Corps of Engineers is facing severe funding shortfalls, we need to explore new ways to bring private support to our public assets.
My bipartisan, bicameral bill is the right approach to stop polluters from dumping sewage in the Great Lakes. We need to protect Lake Michigan, the crown jewel of the Midwest and the source of drinking water for millions.

Our men and women in uniform shouldn't have to come home and fight just to make ends meet.   The Veterans Jobs Caucus demonstrates a commitment to put more than two million returning skilled service members back to work.   As a U.S. Navy Reservist, I have served with some of the most talented men and women our nation has to offer, and it is heartening that business leaders across the country recognize the tremendous value these veterans possess.

As the economic crossroads of America, Illinois should be the best place in the nation to locate and grow a business. While we may differ on many issues, Gov. Quinn and I agree that our brightest days are ahead of us.  To build a better future for Illinois families, our state leaders should be focused on solving our fiscal crisis, including unfunded pension liabilities, and not the next election. We have an incredible opportunity to right our fiscal ship and prove Illinois is without a doubt the best place in the nation to locate a business.

Washington, D.C.'s appetite for over-spending has led to unsustainable, excessive borrowing.  In this era of trillion-dollar deficits, giving the President additional borrowing authority without even a dime of spending cuts in exchange is not sound fiscal policy. Continuing down this path will result in higher interest rates and a worsening of the United States' credit rating in the global economy.  Only a long-term solution to our fiscal problems will give our markets the stability that they need and deserve

Gun trafficking is allowing gangs and violence to flourish in Chicago. The Chicago Crime Commission reported that Chicago Police confiscate an average of 13,000 illegal weapons each year. Last summer, gang violence killed 500 men, women and children in Chicago. We must put a stop to this cycle, which is why I have joined with Senator Gillibrand to take serious action to prevent straw purchases and ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to crack down on illegal weapons trafficking.
I want to thank Secretary Ray LaHood for his many years of service to the people of Illinois and this country, and I applaud his ability to bring people together.    I add myself to the many voices in Washington who agree that he will be missed.
I congratulate Senator Kerry on his confirmation to be Secretary of State. I look forward to working with him to strengthen our national security, promote American values abroad and support our democratic allies.
I strongly condemn the sentencing of  Pastor Saeed. The United States must sanction the Iranian judge Pir-Abbasi
